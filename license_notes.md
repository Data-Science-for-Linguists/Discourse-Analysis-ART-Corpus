# License Notes:

To access the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus from the Australian National Corpus, I was required to sign a 
[terms of use](https://www.ausnc.org.au/about-1/terms-of-use) page.

Each person is allowed to download one version of the corpus, and can use it for research or study purposes. 
However, the data is owned by Macquarie University and is only allowed to be used for research or study purposes. 
This data is closed and I am not allowed to be relicense the data or distribute it online.

Even though the data cannot be relicensed, I *can* license my script. I have opted for the MIT License, an open source license that allows others to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
