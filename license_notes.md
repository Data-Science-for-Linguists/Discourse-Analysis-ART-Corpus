To access the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus from the Australian National Corpus, I was required to sign a terms of use page:
https://www.ausnc.org.au/about-1/terms-of-use

Each person is allowed to download one version of the corpus, and can use it for research or study purposes. 
However, the data is owned by Macquarie University and is only allowed to be used for research or study purposes. 
This data is closed and I am not allowed to be relicense the data or distribute it online.

My .gitignore was set up incorrectly so I need to restart my repo.
