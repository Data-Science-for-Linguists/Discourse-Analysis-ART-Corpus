To access the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus from the Australian National Corpus, I was required to sign a terms of use page:
https://www.ausnc.org.au/about-1/terms-of-use

Each person is allowed to download one version of the corpus, and can use it for research or study purposes. 
However, the data is owned by Macquarie University and is only allowed to be used for research or study purposes. 
This data is closed and I am not allowed to be relicense the data or distribute it online.

My .gitignore was set up incorrectly, so my data was in my original repo. Therefore, I began this second repo.

Even though the data cannot be relicensed, I can license my script. This script is helpful because it fixes errors in transcription.
My script ensures that each speaker's information (given during their first utterance), is in the same format. 
Also, it gives each speaker a unique speaker identity so that speakers can be compared across text files.
