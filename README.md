# Discourse Analysis of the Australian Radio Talkback 

## Summary: 

I will do a discourse analysis of the raw text files in the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus.
These files include speaker information within [], such as the speaker's role (presenter, caller, or expert), their name, and their gender.
They also include back channels and laughter, indicated by <> and spelling corrections, indicated by {}.
For this project, I will compare the number of turns, vocabulary size, and number of sentences and words across speaker roles and gender.
I will also look at backchannels, laughter, and interruptions to see how the speaker's role and/or gender affect these aspects of conversation.
