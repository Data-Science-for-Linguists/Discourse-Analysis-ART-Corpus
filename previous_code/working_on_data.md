') or a new ‘reading’?\nThe recourse to books, documents, or sources, underscores a perception which is somehow already in the air.\nThe effort to recapture art's ‘history’ is always entangled with the desire to remake its identity and meaning as part of contemporary struggles.\nThis article comes out of the familiar experience of being drawn to a particular image, or set of images, without at first knowing why, and the attempt to account for this feeling.\nLooking intermittently at the so-called colonial art of Latin America in churches, museums, private collections and books, I became magnetised by the figures of angels.\nThey are extraordinarily resplendent.\nThey have a material splendour in their dress.\nThe spiritual (or is it the psychic?) intensity of their presence goes together with a marvellous air of freedom and delicacy.\nThey have a tendency to expand, to fill the picture space.\nIf the angel is already a hybrid (a human with wings), the Latin American angels seem to incorporate further incongruities into this composite of the human and the supernatural which hints at further, latent meanings.\nI knew that these paintings were produced for the Spanish in the decades after their conquest of Latin America, and represented the christianising of the old centres of Inca culture, in Peru and Bolivia especially.\nI knew that in the main they were painted by Indian and mestizo artists at the command of the Europeans.\nIt lodged in my mind to try and answer the question as to whether there was something special about the depiction of angels in post-conquest art, and if so, what it could be.\nI didn't make a systematic study but I occasionally followed up clues if I came across references in books and catalogues.\nI soon learned that the theme of angels was one of the most popular in the paintings produced by indigenous artists for the complex iconographic programmes of the churches and missions established by the Spanish after the conquest.\nThis word ‘popular’ is of course problematic and will be returned to a little later.\nAll colonial painting began in a process of copying.\nIndian artists were obliged, or forced, to abandon their own forms of representation and learn the European way.\nBut after a period of sheer copying, some themes took off.\nSome developed differently in the American context.\nWhy did angels especially flourish?\nAs I investigated further, it seemed to become clear that if this question could be answered it could only be in a complex way.\nThese paintings, in other words, could only be read as the site of a complex play of forces.\nThey were not simply transcriptions of the power of the conquerors and the coercive force with which they attempted to annihilate the existing culture and beliefs of the Indians and impose Christianity.\nNor, obviously, were they a simple expression of Indian resistance to this assault.\nIn some way they were both these things at once.\nThe more I looked into it the more the paintings seemed to go beyond simple unitary ideas of authorship and meaning.\nThe Peruvian art historian Luis Enrique Tord has written:\nThe Spanish conquest of the Inca empire had a profound impact on many aspects of Indian society, but by far the most serious blows suffered by the Andean peoples were administered by the Church.\nThe efforts of priests and missionaries to eradicate the Indians' ancestral beliefs produced profound emotional disturbances as well as great changes in their conception of the world.\nTo enforce conformity to the new orthodoxy, the Spaniards instituted ecclesiastical visitas , or inspections intended to extirpate the idolatory that persisted long after the conquest.\nIn the sphere of art the range of subjects and genres permitted by the church was extremely narrow, only in fact religious paintings and portraits.\nAt that time after the conquest there was effectively no ‘thought’(recorded discourse) outside the religious framework and institutions.\nThe first university in Peru, for example, was founded by the Dominicans.\nPainting was from the beginning one of the most important instruments of conquest in the sphere of thinking, the mind.\nIn the earliest years of their missionary efforts Dr Tord writes:\nthe friars discovered that the Indians were deeply impressed by sacred images created with the newest artistic techniques brought from the Old World…\nThose images were first seen in the catechisms, Bibles, books of hours, and hymnals used to convert the Indians and direct their worship.\n‘The Archangel Raphael’, by a follower of Luis de Riano, Cuzco School c. 1640.\nOil on canvas, 65″ x 42″.\nConvento de San Francisco, La Paz.\nThe Jesuits brought over their leading painter in Europe in the late sixteenth century, the Italian Bernardo Bitti, to live and work in Cuzco.\nA school of painting grew up in Cuzco which became the leading centre of the production of paintings south of Mexico and exported paintings and painters to many other parts of the continent including remote areas.\nLeopoldo Castedo, the Spanish-Chilean art historian writes:\nOf forty-seven painters documented in Cuzco during the period, thirty-five were Indians, seven criollos or mestizos, four Spaniards, and one Italian.\nThis list does not include the great number of Indians who remained anonymous….\nThe similes usually used to describe the stylistic hybrid produced over the years by the Cuzco painters — the ‘melding’, or ‘blending’, or the ‘intricate amalgamation’ of European and indigenous traditions to produce an art of ‘Byzantine richness and splendour’— obviously belies the violence of events.\nThese phrases do, however, have the ring of truth in an aesthetic sense — or rather there was an aesthetic process involved which had to some extent its own story.\nThis was manifested not only in the precise, artistic and critical response by Indian peoples to European paintings, but also in connoisseurship within the colonising ranks.\nA blossoming of the arts followed the rebuilding of Cuzco after the catastrophic earthquake of 1650, partly due to the arrival of Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo.\nHis collection included two El Grecos, and other outstanding Spanish pictures, and he sponsored Indian painters like Diego Quispe Tito, as well as sculptors, architects and jewellers.\nSometimes the coercion and oppression is felt directly in the paintings: for example, in images of Saint Isidore, a rather obscure Spanish saint vastly amplified in the New World as the patron of labourers, who is shown to carry a small bag of coca leaves as the Indian peasants and miners did, and do, to chew to combat hunger and fatigue.\nCastedo points this out.\nHe also shows that images of Santiago (St James) staying the moors were often changed to Santiago slaying the Indians .\nIndian painters would in this case be painting an image showing the Church's and the State's warning to Indians who contemplated rebellion, as many did.\nAnd occasionally, as, for example, during or around the time of the rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II in 1780, an image would appear of explicit resistance to colonialism.\nIn the somewhat unlikely context of the Pelican History of Art (the relevant volume is Art and Architecture in Spain and Portugal and their American Dominions 1500–1800 ), an anonymous painting is described which shows America:\nnursing Spanish noble boys.\nNegroes and mestizos are pressing around her throne, while nude Indian children weep abandoned.\nTwo richly dressed Indian couples present their gifts in a beautiful park crowded with different animals.\nThe legend says: Where in the world has one seen what one sees here…\nHer own sons lie groaning and she suckles strangers.\nThe images of angels are much more ambiguous and capable of different interpretations (this could, of course, be said of the angel theme generally as it recurs in the history of art, and in various guises across different cultures).\nIt is not hard to find documentary evidence for the Church's deliberate use of the angel theme as an instrument of conversion.\nThe Bolivian art historian Teresa Gisbert writes that the Councils of Lima, which were responsible for questions of orthodoxy in the Viceroyalty: ‘sought to attract Indians to the new faith by the use of images which would be especially appealing to them.'\nWhy were angels appealing to them?\nIn the Pelican History, Martin Soria tentatively puts forward the theory that angels were popular because ‘they replaced similar messengers in pre-conquest beliefs’.\nTeresa Gisbert produces evidence to show that Diego Quispe Tito's series of paintings of the zodiac for the Cathedral of Cuzco was commissioned in order to counteract the traditional indigenous worship of the stars and were intended to aid in Christianising the Indians of the Andes.\nAnd she suggests that the angels, especially the series of angels, could have a similar purpose, to ‘replace worship of celestial phenomena with the theologically acceptable cult of the angels’.\nSo apparently they were ‘popular’, for different reasons, with both Christian and native American, with oppressor and oppressed.\nIt is as if you could read in them simultaneously transcriptions of inducement, threat, coercion, protection, solace, yearning and resistance.\nDoes this explain their complex expressivity?\nFor the same quality can be interpreted differently according to one's point of view, one's experience, and one's feelings.\nProtection can mean Defence of the Faith, i.e. of Christianity, or it can mean the adoption and identification of a ‘guardian spirit’, who will watch over your life-journey, a universal, but at the same time very individual and personal desire, expressed in most religions and cultures.\nLooking at the angel's image you can dream, ask for what you want.\nThe angel, with its brilliantly opulent but light clothing, its mobility, its freedom from hierarchical placing in the pictorial composition, and its bisexuality, is an intimate image of enablement.\nAmong the images of angels is a genre apparently unique to South America, even to the Andes, the Angels with Guns.\nThis was also a very popular subject (one church inventory for 1748, for example, lists 36 pictures of armed angels).\nJulia P. Herzberg, who calls these pictures ‘representations of winged  beings at once military, aristocratic and religious, gives this explanation of their raison d'être:\nPaintings of angels with guns appeared at a time when the religious orders were confronted with the stubborn persistence of pre-conquest religion amongst their Indian charges.\nImmense problems remained not merely in the campaign to destroy Indian idols, but in teaching and reinforcing the principles of the new faith.\nSermons and catechisms were of course the primary means of conversion, but images of angels with guns were useful symbols of important teachings of the church.\nThe Spaniards conquered the Incas with both the Cross and the arquebus.\nThe key to understanding the religious function of these images is found in the gun motif.\nFirearms, unknown to the Indians at the time of the conquest, seemed a frightening manifestation of the supernatural, for they ‘fled out of fear when there was a blare of trumpets, the roar of arquebuses and artillery’.\nThe firearm in an angel's hands must have had a powerful impact on Indian converts.\nBut since guns were also used defensively, the images functioned symbolically as reminders of the protection offered to those who embraced Christianity.\nThe image of the angel with a gun served a secular as well as a religious function by emphasising the lesson that the Church and the Spanish colonial régime were united in their goal to christianize the Indians.\nThe military aspect of the crusade is subliminally suggested by the gentle figure who handles his firing weapon in varied positions which recall those of a fighting force.\nIn speaking about the angels' clothing, Herzberg continues:\nFar more important than the military aspects of the angel's costumes are the explicit references to the high social status of both Spanish colonial gentlemen and Inca royalty.\nRichly brocaded fabrics, ribbons, and lace characterize the opulent viceregal dress of the 17th century.\nThe gentlemen-aristocratic nature of angels with guns is defined by their elegant dress, which relates them directly to the ruling viceregal aristocracy.\nA key phrase here seems to me to be ‘gentle figure who handles his firing weapon’.\nAlthough the technical military details of loading and handling the gun and so on, of the angel paintings, is very precise — taken in fact from a Flemish military manual of 1607 — the ‘common soldier’ of the image in the manual is not retained: he becomes the gorgeous aristocrat.\nThe non-aggressive angel-like  pose, is of course extremely seductive, which makes the threat of force oblique, only implied, as if a beautiful face was being laid over the ugly face of violent coercion.\nAre these pictures simply transcriptions of power, in which the hard approach is mixed with the soft, and the Church is allied with the State (and in this case hinting as well, not just at the foreigner's domination of the native inhabitants but also at class conflict within colonial society, since the angel is a mélange of Spanish and Inca aristocracies)?\nPerhaps.\nBut again they seem to me more enigmatic, more multiple — images full of aesthetic tensions.\nCan one again make a conflation between domination and rebellion in the image, an expression of both the Church/State and the Indian wishes?\nLeopoldo Castedo writes:\nThe prestige of the armed archangel was and is still very great.\nIn mestizo architectural decoration of the 18th century, the archangel brandishing the flaming sword had a prominent place (particularly fine examples are in the Cathedral of Puno and San Lorenzo, in Potosi); and in the traditional diablada boliviana (Bolivian devil play), a religious drama, the Archangel Michael defeats […]the Devil of the Seven Masks.\nIn 1950, in a curious or consistent coincidence (as Castedo Pointedly calls it $, Pope Pius XII declared the Archangel Michael patron of police — a decision that may well diminish the archangel's prestige in Latin America.\n‘Archangel with Gun’, by an anonymous painter of the Cuzco School, early 18th century.\nOil on canvas, 63 1/4″ x 39 1/2″.\nMuseo de Arte, Lima.\n‘Archangel with Gun’, by the Master of Calamarca (José Lopez du los Rios?)\nLake Titicaca School, c. 1684.\nOil on canvas, 63 5/8″ x 46 1/2″.\nMuseo Nacional de Arte, La Paz.\nAside from dealing, as I have been doing, with one of the major subjects and themes of Cuzco painting, an inventory could be made of ways in which painters departed from European models, or from academic notions of excellence.\nThere are peripheral insertions, like borders of flowers, or tropical birds which populate the background landscapes of many religious paintings.\nOr survivals at the level of colour: liking for flat and intense colours, local earth and vegetable dyes, which may go all the way back to the ancient textile traditions such as that of the Paracas culture in Peru.\nAlso, intensification of the colours in the angels' wings as compared with Europe.\nThese questions were not merely ‘academic’.\nDisputes among Spanish and Indian painters themselves, in some ways antecedents of all subsequent debates around ‘indigenism’, go back to the early days in Cuzco.\nIn 1688 the Cuzco guild of painters split.\nThe immediate reason seems to have been that Indian painters working for some of the Spanish and criollo masters complained of mistreatment.\nThe Spanish admitted their guilt but no agreement could be reached and the two sides moved apart.\nThe Spanish guild tightened its European rules of style.\nThe Indian painters lost contact with European developments and, according to Teresa Gisbert, ‘sought inspiration both in the old styles and in their own tastes and traditions’, a mixture of ornamental stylisation with observation of the reality around them.\nTheir religious pictures, she writes, ‘belong to an archaic world […$ who viewed the religious realm as something ‘different’ from mundane reality.'\nThe argument so far has been intended to put forward the possibility that an art work or image could be official and coercive, and unofficial and subversive, all at the same time.\nThe example I have given is by no means the only one that exists.\nThe  same process has been documented in other situations where a people have been conquered, colonised and their cultural beliefs assaulted.\nEduardo Mondlane found that African carvers in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Mozambique had made their own use of Christian themes imposed by priests and missionaries:\nWhen a [makonde]sculptor departs from the stereotype […$ this is nearly always because an element of doubt or defiance has been worked into it; a madonna is given a demon to hold instead of the Christ Child; a priest is represented with the feet of a wild animal, a pietà becomes a study not of sorrow but of revenge, with the mother raising a spear over the body of her dead son.\nMagazine advertisement, featuring a painting by Botero.\nSuch images may startlingly demonstrate the general truth that the meaning of a work cannot simply be equated with its subject.\nBut particularly intriguing is the phenomenon of syncretisation itself, as an artistic process, and its relationship to meaning: the process whereby something new is created that cannot simply be reduced to either side of two antagonistic forces, or returned to a former ‘purity’.\nA new ‘in-between’ is created.\nThis is especially true in the context of Latin America where this kind of duality and fusion has been a feature of culture from the time of the conquest right up until today — both on the popular and the intellectual level.\n‘Latin America is such a syncretic, eccentric, disjointed fusion of European, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean culture,’ in the words of the Mexican artist Guillermo Gomez-Peña.\nOr, as the Chilean painter Juan Davila recently put it: ‘You take something of yourself, something of the conqueror’.\nIn both cases these are intellectuals talking about their own work by linking it with a process continually taking place at a popular level and in everyday life.\nToday, the image of the angel is still alive, and still in contention; it has by no means been merely consigned to the museum.\nIt is still a part of contemporary power struggles.\nOn the one hand it has appeared as a focus for resistance.\nThe militant angel appeared, for example, in wall paintings in Haiti during the shortlived popular uprising for food and democracy of 1986.\nThe extraordinarily effective popular figure of the masked Superbarrio, who emerged spontaneously to lead the movement to demand the provision of proper housing in the aftermath of the disastrous Mexican earthquake of 1986, surely appeals to memories of the angel-enabler, along with references to Mexican popular masked wrestling heroes and perhaps to Superman.\nAt the same time, the armed angel is continually reproduced as a figure of folklore, a naive stereotype of Latin America, typically exploited in the paintings of Fernando Botero, the highest selling Latin American artist in the world today.\nHis shallow humour trades in, but misses the actual drama and sensibility of that hybrid fusion of the aristocratic and the popular which took place all those years ago in Cuzco.\nSymbolic angel lances a Tonton Macoute on a mural in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 1989.\nPhoto by Pablo Butcher.\nAn Inca Warrior in the guise of the Archangel Michael with a flaming sword.\nStone carving in a church at Potosi, Bolivia, 18th century.\n‘Popular culture is not what is technically called folklore, but the popular language of permanent historical rebellion.’\nThis sentence, by the Brazilian film-maker Glauber Rocha, written at the turn of the 1970s, clearly identifies a form of expression with a mass of oppressed people whose experience has been continuous over at least four centuries.\nAnd Glauber also implies that the forms and images in which this experience is expressed are not fixed but open and changing.\nThe sentence comes from an essay called Eztetyke du Rêve , an eccentric spelling of Esthétique du Rêve (‘Aesthetic of the Dream') in which, building on the idea that ‘the dream is the only right which cannot be forbidden’, Glauber Rocha described how he had come to realise the revolutionary importance of the mystical in Latin American popular culture.\nIt was the only way of contesting that ‘bourgeois reason’ which, for him, was as much a feature of left-wing political programmes as it was of traditional colonial domination.\nIn his 1965 article, ‘Aesthetic of Hunger’, enormously influential on Third World cinema and art, Glauber felt he had given ‘the measure of my rational understanding of poverty’.\nBy 1971 he was saying that, as artists:\nWe must touch, by communion, the vital point of poverty which is its mysticism.\nThis mysticism is the only language which transcends the rational schema of oppression.\nThe role of the angel as an intermediary between the human and the mystical world, and its elaborate beautifying as a vehicle of the dream, would seem to tie in closely with Glauber's identification of a continuing thread of psychological resistance in Latin American culture.\nThe writer would like to express his appreciation of the art historical studies of Teresa Gisbert, Leopoldo Castedo, Julia P. Herzberg and dr Luis Enrique Tord, to which he has been deeply indebted in writing this article .\n‘HER DRESS HANGS HERE': DE-FROCKING THE KAHLO CULT\nOriana Baddeley\nThe 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishment's attitudes towards art produced outside of its traditional parameters.\nThe work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced out of the ‘modern masters’ market.\nAlmost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain — graffiti art, Soviet art, Australian art, the art of Latin America.\nThe major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago.\nThe current status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic example of this change.\nOnce known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera, her reputation outside of Mexico now far supercedes his: since 1919, sale room estimates of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million, and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke all records at Sotheby's New York for a Latin American artist.\nThe enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content.\nWhile the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, it was the publication of Hayden Herrera's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status.\nSince that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries, a feature film (‘Frida’ by Paul Leduc), a stage play, numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing.\nIn May 1989 Elle magazine ran a 16 page feature on Frida Kahlo as the ‘spirit of Mexico’(Fig. 1), while in Vogue (Feb. 1990) there was a 10 page interpretation of ‘the romance of Frida Kahlo's Mexico’(Fig. 2).\nAlmost as a logical outcome of this media blitz, it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna, already a devotee of Kahlo's work, was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo's life.\nFig. 1.\nElle Magazine , May 1989, p. 18–19.\nAs with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination, such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of Kahlo's admittedly fascinating life.\nThe passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera, her flamboyant appearance, but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work.\nWhile Kahlo's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life, for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art.\nIn this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of Van Gogh, a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death.\nThe archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990's long hot summer.\nYet despite the iconic status of Van Gogh's ‘tragic’ life, it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified, his thick impasto brush-stroke, his vibrant yellows, the urgency of his creative drive.\nIn the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself, the characteristic brows, the elaborate hair, the Mexican costume (Fig. 3).\nIt is primarily her appearance, not the formal language of her art, that has graced the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines.\nThe Elle feature transposed the ‘Kahlo style’ to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herrera's biography of  the artist.\nIn the later Vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual, Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their ‘Mexican’ interiors.\nThere is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4).\nThe visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work.\nIn both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself; exotic, passionate, yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit.\nWhile Elle, Vogue and subsequently The Independent (Fig. 5), stressed different facets of Kahlo's public persona, they all shared the emphasis on ‘her’, as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of Mexico, rather than her work.\nIt is her body as the canvas, her appearance as art.\nThe art of self-expression becomes self-expression as art.\nFig. 2.\nVogue , February 1990, p. 130–1.\nFig. 3.\nElle Magazine , May 1989, p. 28.\nOf course, the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlo's case.\nThe majority of her work is self portraiture; her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance.\nDressing up, role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlo's work.\nIn Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair (1944)(Fig. 6), she paints herself wearing Rivera's suit, challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority (while simultaneously) threatening castration).\nMore disturbingly, in The Mask (1945)(Fig. 7), she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions.\nWhere does the mask fall: Does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features ‘mask’ far more than it uncovers?\nThere is, however, an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image, a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933: ‘…some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‘a la Mexicana’, but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible.'\nThe ‘impossibility’ stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo's choice of clothing, a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances.\nThe particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic, by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde.\nFor Kahlo, however, choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana, as for example in Tree of Hope (1946)(Fig. 8), was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity.\nMexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific, varying from region to  region.\nThe Tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-Hispanic forms of clothing.\nIt is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlo's choice.\nThe ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led to the adoption of the Tehuana, in post-revolutionary Mexico, as the image of the strong Indian woman; the undefeated counterpart to the despised ‘Chingada’, who, conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico's hybrid post-conquest culture.\nIn a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict, the Tehuana represents that aspect of Mexico's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule.\nKahlo's adoption of Tehuana dress, while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body, asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position.\nFig. 4.\nVogue , February 1990, p. 138.\nFig. 5.\nThe Independent on Sunday , 8th April 1990, p. 37.\nIn Kahlo's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses, yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work.\nIt is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved.\nHer work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman's art.\nThe fascination with functions of the body, the analogies between artistic  and physical creative processes, self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s.\nFig. 6 .\nFrida Kahlo:Self-portrait with cropped hair , 1940, 40x27.9 cm.\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York.\nFig. 7.\nFrida Kahlo: The Mask , 1945, 40x30.5 cm.\nColl.\nDolores Olmeda.\nFig. 8 .\nFrida Kahlo:The Tree of Hope , 1946, 55.9x40.6 cm.\nColl.\nIsidore Ducasse Fine Arts Inc.\nIn their formal language, Kahlo's works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments; the adoption of the decorative, the intimate and non-fine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of ‘high art’.\nThis ‘appropriateness’ of Kahlo's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context, to stress the collective and the cross-cultural.\nAlthough this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic, it has diminished the complexity of Kahlo's achievement as a specifically Mexican painter, operating within the particularities of her historical moment.\nMore problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her ‘Mexicanness’ as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work, thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by Breton as a ‘ribbon round a bomb’.\nIt is the ribbon that runs through the pages of Vogue , the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work such as Kahlo's The Suicide of Dorothy Hale (1939)(Fig. 9).\nIn this painting, a memorial to a woman's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her.\nHale's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of New York and North America in general.\nThe story behind Hale's death was one with which Kahlo obviously identified, and within which dress formed an important symbolic function.\nBefore jumping from the window of her apartment, Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress, the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer.\nIn Kahlo's painting, the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street, literally coming down to earth.\nHale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer, a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture.\nThe horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building.\nShe leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world.\nAlthough destroyed, she has also escaped.\nThe painting, dedicated to Hale's mother, was commissioned by a mutual friend of Kahlo and Dorothy Hale, the managing editor of Vanity Fair , Clare Boothe Luce.\nThe painting was agreed to by Luce in part to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend.\nHaving lent Hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an haute-couture dress, and refused to turn up to what, in retrospect, became Hale's farewell party.\nLater it was revealed that the money had come from a different source.\nA male friend had tried to dissuade Hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy ‘the most beautiful dress in New York’, telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband.\nOn one level this work deals with a generalised ‘woman's experience’, yet the metaphorical power of Dorothy Hale's dress derives from Kahlo's use of clothing in her own self-portraits.\nDress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses.\nHale's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the ‘Gringolandia’ so hated by Kahlo.\nIn those paintings where Kahlo wears European dress she is passive, weak and unable to control her own destiny, but in the Tehuana costume she is strong, powerful, hopeful.\nUnclothed, her body becomes yet more vulnerable, but as Jean Franco states:\nThe unclothed body is not a ‘self but a socialised body, a body that is opened by instruments, technologized, wounded, its organs displayed to the outside world.\nThe ‘inner’ Frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed Frida, who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer.\nKahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of Mexico's colonised past: La Llorona ‘the weeping woman’ of popular myth and La Chingada, the raped and abused mother described in Paz's The Labyrinth of Solitude .\nDescended from an Aztec mother goddess, Llorona is a long-suffering mother figure, symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the  Spanish invasion.\nDriven mad with grief by the loss of her child, she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the pre-Conquest past.\nAt its most simple, La Chingada, as the mother of Mestizo culture is ‘the Mother forcibly opened, violated or deceived’.\nThe female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the Spanish invaders.\nThe Indian Mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child.\nThe rhetoric of the Tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma, and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance.\nFig 9 .\nFrida Kahlo:The Suicide of Dorothy Hale , 1939, 58.1x47.5 cm.\nPhoenix Art Museum, Arizona.\nA major, though often ignored, work by Kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art.\nMy Dress Hangs There (1939)(Fig. 10) is one of the artist’ s most formally adventurous works, mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of North American culture.\nKahlo does not appear in the work, her Tehuana costume hangs empty in the centre of the composition, suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy.\nOn one level My Dress…is a coda to Self-Portrait on the Borderline (1932)(Fig. 11) of the previous year.\nThis small painting on metal, in the style of a Catholic votive image, shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist North America and the archaic fertility of Mexico.\nInterwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America.\nThis is done by a series of juxtapositions; the past versus the present; female nature versus masculine technology; growth versus exploitation; and in its very material presence, the traditions of fine art versus the popular.\nAt the same time the ambivalence of her own, and modern Mexico's position is manifested in the figure of the artist.\nThe paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand.\nThe red and green of the Aztec necklace links it compositionally with the indigenous plants to the ‘south’ of the painting, the pink colonial-style dress tonally blending with the skyscrapers to the ‘north’.\nMy Dress …again suggests a conflict, but the ambivalence is gone.\nNature has been banished, technology and its concomitant values reign over a harshly masculine world.\nThree elements refer to the female presence, all of them dealing with an essential lack.\nThe empty dress, a peeling poster of Mae West and in the far distance the Statue of Liberty.\nFig. 10 .\nFrida Kahlo:My Dress Hangs There , 1933, 46x50 cm, estate of dr.\nLeo Eloesser.\nAlthough occasionally humorous, the work presents a bleak view of urban alienation.\nThe Church, Wall Street, and Industry are joined by a network of telephone lines, forming a remorsely inhuman environment.\nBeneath this man-made mechanism of oppression are the people, literally distanced from their surroundings by Kahlo's use of photo-collage.\nIn the forefront of this scene flutters the dress, incongruously vibrant despite its suggestion of loss.\nDislocated from its political context, it hangs like a piñata above the teeming streets of the city; decorative yet potentially explosive.\nThere is no place ‘there’ for the values the Tehuana dress represents, its folds are given meaning by Kahlo's search for a cultural identity.\nWithin the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest, a reminder of political alternatives.\nThe physicality so characteristic of Kahlo's work is missing, no flesh, no blood, just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost Liberty.\nThe inter-relationship of body and dress so self-consciously referred to in many of Kahlo's most polemical works (Fig. 12) has been strangely inverted by her current popularity.\nHer ‘Mexicanness’ has become a stylistic gloss, decorative, colourful, pretty, even individualistic.\nThe colonised body which Kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering.\nWhat is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing, in both art and life, that Kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history.\nFig. 11

D.F.\nSURREALISING THE BAROQUE: MEXICO'S SPANISH HERITAGE AND THE WORK OF ALBERTO GIRONELLA\nValerie Fraser\nIt is a truism to say that that which cannot be readily classified will tend to be overlooked.\nIn Art History the rehabilitation of artists and bodies of work which have been overlooked has been going on since Vasari made such a good job of classifying Florentine art that all other art in Italy and beyond has had to be defined, at least until this century, and at some level even now, in relation to Vasari's classifications, or at least in relation to the model of stylistic evolution which he outlined.\nNon-Italian artists, non-Italian preoccupations, women artists, artists working in media other than Vasari's chosen painting, sculpture and architecture, non-Western art and so on: critics have been busy reviewing such areas and, in so doing, producing new categories and classifications.\nLatin American art has been undergoing such a review both from within Latin America itself and from elsewhere, with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in Europe and the US.\nThat there should be an issue of the Oxford Art Journal devoted to Latin American art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts.\nBut new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive.\nWithin the field of Latin American art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern.\nIn the case of the work of the Mexican Alberto Gironella, the reason would seem to be precisely because of his insistent concentration on art of a very different category — that of Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly court portraiture.\nAmong the more comprehensive books on twentieth-century Mexican art in recent years, Shifra Goldman only mentions him in passing, Luis Cardoza y Aragón says little more than that Gironella ‘escapes him’, and Ida Rodriguez Prampolini dismisses him from her discussion of Mexican surrealism as an ‘international’ artist, more closely related to Spain than to Mexico.\nWhen he has inspired sympathetic coverage, the results tend to be not so much an exposition of Gironella's achievements but belong to that particular branch of literature which uses works of art as a starting point for literary excursus.\nOctavio Paz's elegant essay is the prime example, where despite some insightful remarks he uses Gironella's work to make general observations about the creative role of the critic, for example, or for digressive flourishes on Spanish culture.\nWhen they met in Paris in 1963, Breton hailed him as a surrealist, but in a recent interview Gironella disclaimed so tidy a classification, saying he is as much a baroque artist as a surrealist.\nIn fact, although there are both surreal and baroque elements in his work, Gironella prefers to call it mestizo’, a term which has often had negative, racist overtones but which has been acclaimed in this century, especially in Mexico, as a positive value, indeed the distinguishing feature of Mexican culture: the rich and fruitful mixture of the European with the indigenous American.\nThis rather simple notion, that there is one single Mexican culture, problematic principally because it tends to valorize the European over the indigenous and to ignore the diversity, and richness of the latter, but also, conversely, because it excludes or denigrates the more purely European aspects of the culture.\nNevertheless it seems to me that Gironella is right, or that he is right in so far as he is using ‘mestizo’ to claim for his work a Mexican, not a European identity.\nHe is probably also right when he says that he is only seen as a Spanish artist because his interest lies in Spanish art, instead of in French art ‘like everyone else': in other words, within the accepted categories there is no room for a Mexican who is interested in Spanish art.'\nMy purpose in what follows is to try to place him within a Mexican context.\nGironella's subject matter is the acclaimed artistic masterpieces of the Spanish past which he reworks in various ways, most dramatically into ironic altars assembled from a variety of painted, sculpted and ready-made elements (Fig. 1).\nFavoured subjects are court portraiture, and allegorical images of death, decay and the transience of life, usually handled with the blackest of black humour.\nFavoured artists are Goya and his predecessors in the Golden Age —— El Greco, Pereda, Valdés Leal and above all Velázquez.\nIt is worth emphasising that the period spanned by the lives of El Greco and Velázquez saw in Latin America the consolidation of colonial government and of the Christian church, the establishment of the Spanish language and of European culture, the introduction of new methods of exploitation of people and resources.\nGoya's life, on the other hand, coincides with the decline and ultimate collapse of the Empire; Spanish rule in America had been overthrown by the time of his death in 1828.\nIn other words, these artists lived during Latin American's formative years.\nthe work of the artists who interpreted their historical reality on to canvas, but the importance in Latin America of the art itself should not be underestimated, particularly the iconography of the monarchy.\nVelázquez's name, for example, would have been familiar to very few Mexicans in the seventeenth century, but as the only artist authorised to execute likenesses of the King his official portraits of Philip IV and the innumerable engravings after them would have been well known.\nA painting by his contemporary, Juan Bautista Maino,The Recapture of Bahia , of 1635, represents the recapture of the harbour of Bahia in Brazil (then under Spanish control) from the Dutch in 1625.\n(Fig. 2) While an injured man is tended in the foreground, the Dutch forces to the right kneel in homage before an allegorical tapestried portrait of Philip IV.\nThis is a highly unusual painting in a number of ways, not least because no such royal portrait could ever have existed, including as it does, and on almost equal status with the king, the figure of his ambitious minister the Count-Duke of Olivares.\nNevertheless, on special occasions the Spanish authorities in America would certainly have erected large representations of the king in this manner, as objects of semi-religious devotion.\nOn the death of a member of the royal family elaborate catafalques were constructed in cathedrals throughout the Empire and the deceased mourned in effigy.\nPaintings and prints were distributed to colonial officials for display in much the same way as British embassies are provided with an official photographic portrait of the Queen.\nIn other words, the focus of Gironella's attention is neither historically nor iconographically arbitrary, although in some ways his reworkings of the paintings of others could be seen to be simply an extension of a fairly conventional activity.\nWithin the Western tradition of art we tend to take it for granted that much can be learned from the study of the art of the past and, traditionally, copying from the works of the Great Masters was one of a young student's most important tasks.\nThis activity, this dependence on the art of the past, is not, in itself, ideologically highly-charged.\nReynolds may have admired and borrowed from Michelangelo, and while this could be said to represent, perhaps, a long-standing tradition of cultural domination — or the domination in England of the Italianate tastes of the English upper classes — it would be a mistake to make too much of this.\nIn the case of Latin America it is more complex.\nHistorically the relationship between Latin America and Europe is not only one of cultural domination of the former by the latter, but of political and economic domination.\nWhile the obvious colonial ties have been broken, the power still lies elsewhere.\nThe sources of domination have in some ways simply broadened to include the US, japan, and international capitalism.\nWithin the art world the problem remains that the production of art in Latin America, from a student's training to the art market, is rooted firmly in the European tradition, while to compound the difficulties, few Latin American museums can boast any examples of European, North American or even non-national art at all.\nEverything conspires to exacerbate the situation: conventional art education teaches an art-historical line of descent through the successive achievements of the Great Masters, but such works are unavailable in Latin America except in the form of often poor-quality reproductions.\nIn this sense things have not changed much since the seventeenth century.\nGironella always seems acutely aware of these issues.\nFor him the reworking of familiar images is not simply a matter of drawing attention to the way in which mass-reproduction numbs the optic nerves, by shocking the spectator with a moustached Mona Lisa, but rather, using a peculiar blend of both iconoclasm and a sort of wry homage, of investigating the power of certain images, particularly those which have national resonance.\nIn this sense his Habsburg and Bourbon portraits are not dissimilar to Jasper Johns' American flag series, except of course that the flag, whatever individuals may think of it, is unquestionably American, the lineage is clear.\nThe connecting threads between the Spanish  monarchy and colonial Mexico, between Spanish artists and Mexican, between past and present, are tangled or broken.\nWithin Spanish art itself, on the other hand, the line is almost too simple: Goya was intensely aware of Velázquez, Picasso of both, but for Gironella the problem is not just that Picasso could be seen to have inserted himself into the next place in the sequence but that as a Mexican an unequivocal position in any such art-historical lineage is utterly unattainable.\nFig. 1 .\nAlberto Gironella,Lot y sus hijas (Lot and his Daughters), 1984-1987; retable, 303 x 241.5 x 30 cms, collection of the artist.\nPhotograph: Jorge Pablo de Aguinaco, courtesy Galeria OMR, Mexico.\nGironella was born in Mexico City in 1929.\nHis rather was Catalan; he had come to Mexico as a young man and worked in his brother-in-law's grocery shop.\nHe later set up his own business importing groceries from Europe, particularly from Spain.\nHis mother was Yucatecan, a mestiza from Mérida, but she was ‘catalanised’, as Gironella put it, by his father and grandmother; in other words a jointly Eurocentric upbringing, but, perhaps significantly, without personal contact with Europe until his first visit to Paris in 1960.\nHe absorbed European culture through nineteenth-century French novels, and through the literature of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain, the Spanish cultural Golden Age.\nHis major literary enterprise, as a student at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma in 1951, was the invention of a bad Golden Age poet whom he named Tiburcio Esquirla.\nHis later artistic inventions display the same fascination with the possibilities of getting inside the skin of another era.\nThrough his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars, historians, literary critics and art historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can ‘belong’ to the dynasty of European art is, as it were, to invade it retrospectively.\nThe decisive move from literature to painting came in 1952.\nGironella seems to have been very confident about the change, as in the same year he was instrumental, together with Vlady and Héctor Xavier, in establishing a new art gallery in Mexico City, the Galeria Prisse.\nThis quickly emerged as one of the most avant-garde of the new Mexican galleries, and the locus of a group of young artists, including José Luis Cuevas, who ‘with no fixed programme and no common plastic language,[…]were united only by the desire for change’.\nTheir discontent at this time was principally with the social realism of the muralist school but, even at this early date, there was unease with the propaganda emanating from the US that Abstract Expressionism was  the only possible alternative.\nGironella's solution was entirely individual: to focus on the art of the European past, looming large as it did in Latin American consciousness regardless of how often it had been declared dead and buried by Europeans.\nFig. 2 .\nJuan Bautista de Maino,The Recapture of Bahia , 1635, oil on canvas.\nMadrid, Prado.\nHis artistic career began with a series of paintings based on the thirteenth-century sculpture of the elegant countess of Uta on the façade of Naumburg cathedral, a photograph of which had been lent to him by the young artist Vlady, but in the late fifties he turned his attention to Spanish art.\nHis early choice of subject set the tone for his later work —— Goya's Queen Maria Luisa, and Velázquez's portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano (Fig. 3)— in other words, great Spanish artists' handling of their arrogant, ugly, bizarre or idiotic sitters.\nHe subjected both to repeated analysis, ending up with a version of Maria Luisa in which she is transformed into a sharp-beaked, staring owl, and of Francisco Lezcano in which he has metamorphosed into a dog.\nIn both, Gironella is exploring the characters of the sitters as suggested in their portraits rather than the formal, painterly qualities.\nIs Velázquez's Francisco Lezcano simple-minded, or is his expression one of aloofness and distance?\nGironella has said he was drawn to this painting because Lezcano is holding some playing cards, so his disconcertingly direct gaze is inviting us in to test our wits and/or our luck against him.\nQueen Maria Luisa, wife of Charles IV, an unlovely, clever, deceitful and immensely powerful woman, is metamorphosed into a barn-owl, a lechuza , a word which in Spanish also means an ugly hag or a procuress.\nGironella's first direct encounter with Velázquez was at an exhibition of his work at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1959.\nAmongst the works on view was the one to which he has returned most often — the portrait of Queen Mariana of Austria, second wife of Philip IV, painted in 1652 (Fig. 4).\nThis painting has become a veritable obsession and he has returned to it repeatedly over the past thirty years.\nIt is a full-length portrait showing the young queen very formally dressed, in a stiff conventional pose, looking out at the spectator.\nShe wears a gigantic wig decorated with feathers and red bows, the shape of which echoes that of the wide skirt.\nOne arm rests on the farthingale of the skirt, the hand very delicately holding a large white scarf; the other hand rests on a chair back.\nIn the earliest versions, which date from 1959 — 60, Gironella turns her into a sort of rag doll; perhaps never more than a well-dressed shell, she is now simply a collage of fragments of coarse, torn cloth that appear to be pasted  down with thick smears of paint (Fig. 5).\nThese early half-length versions, like close-up details of the original, also investigate compositional qualities, the slight angle of the torso to the picture plane and the relationship of head and wig to shoulders, as well as emphasising features which are to become increasingly fetishised in subsequent renderings — the massive wig, for example.\nAnd in the second version he introduces a three-dimensional hand not, as in the Velázquez with the fingers straight and limp, but drawn up into an uneasy gesture, that claws at her skirt rather than rests against it.\nThe hand and the wig are to become identifying features, often used in isolation or in conjunction with elements from other pictures.\nThey become relics, like the dismembered remains of Catholic saints that are boxed up and dispersed around Christendom to provide individual churches with the Church's authority.\nFig. 3 .\nVeláquez,Francisco Lezcano or El Nino de Vallecas (The Child of Vallecas), 1637, oil on canvas, 107 x 83 cms.\nMadrid, Prado.\nFig. 4 .\nVeláquez,Queen Mariana , 1652, oil on canvas, 231 x 131 cms.\nMadrid, Prado.\nIn The Black Queen of 1961, Mariana has more substance than in the early collages of rags, and so, being more tangible, is more a victim, of Gironella, of time, of historical circumstances (Fig. 6).\nIn this full-length version Gironella places her square to the picture plane, a crucial adjustment which changes the tone from that of the formality of the original into one of helplessness.\nMoving from her external trappings to her internal structure, he represents her as a sort of wooden skeleton.\nAt her breast, instead of a gold rosette, she wears a brass bell and a series of wheels and cogs, apparently parts of an old-fashioned, manually operated lift.\nShe is like a mechanical musical doll that will perform a ponderous dance when someone turns the dial.\nShe is also black.\nIn particular, the uplifted, unseeing face, and the hand, now even more tense and strained, are modelled in three dimensions and painted shiny black.\nShe is, of course, a parody of her pale, former Habsburg self, but Gironella's title,La Reina Negra , suggests a range of different resonances, as indeed it does in English.\nShe is a piece in an international game of chess; she is gloomy and melancholic; she is also, rather more strongly than in English, unlucky, wretched, doomed.\nBut conversely, in Latin America,negra or neqrita are often used as terms of affection.\nas if to ensure, however, that we cannot interpret this work as a declaration of Gironella, s ideas about race and colour in Mexico, there exists another version, almost identical but for the fact that this is a white queen.\nFig. 5 .\nAlberto Gironella,Reina Mariana , 1960, oil and collage on canvas, 100 x 80 cms.\nCollection of Maurice Reims, Paris.\nPhotograph, courtesy Galeria OMR, Mexico.\nFig. 6 .\nAlberto Gironella,Reina Negra (Black Queen), 1961, mixed media on canvas, 108 x 120 cms.\nPrivate Collection.\nIn the following year she is reincarnated, but into wood, not flesh and blood: she becomes furniture, a cross between a throne and a commode, her mask-like head and rigid hand fixed to the chair back, her wig suggested by curly iron coat hooks and carved wooden scrolls and flourishes.\nIn one version, the space beneath the seat contains a small, stuffed cayman and, as this is the equivalent of the space beneath her skirts, there are obvious psycho-sexual overtones.\nIn another there is in fact no seat as such, rather like a monk's misericord, a chair that is not a chair (Fig. 7).\nAgain her heart is represented by the mechanism from an old lift: she goes up and down as others will her.\nThe origins of Gironella's peculiar assemblages lie in his childhood.\nHis earliest memories are of stacks of colourful imported tins, boxes, bottles and packets of the family grocery business, and of the paraphernalia of popular Catholicism, which would have included reliquaries and tabernacles, retables combining paintings and sculpture, altars decorated with damask cloth, candles, flowers and ex votos of an often intensely personal nature.\nHe recalls building himself private altars of chocolate wrappers and tin cans.\nThe packaging of imported products has continued to fascinate him, for intrinsic qualities —— the names, the colours and the designs — but also no doubt because of the way products from far away have been integrated into the domestic Mexican environment.\nSuch products are known by the general term ultramarinos , ‘from across the ocean’, and to emphasise that Mariana herself is also an ultramarina , she is often accompanied in Gironella's tableaux by tins of sardines.\nThere are connections here too with Spanish Golden Age painting which, as Gironella himself has observed, often looks very smelly .\nThe picaresque literature of the period is also very preoccupied with food and drink.\nBut it is not just the strong smells of food, but the metaphorical smells of corruption and moral and social decay which are suggested by the inclusion of such items in his work.\nAnd where the tins of fish are juxtaposed with fragments of Mariana's body the evocation is also of death and putrefaction, perhaps also of coarse jokes about the distinctive ‘fishy’ smell of vaginal secretions.\nGironella's choice of Veláquez's Mariana as the basis for so many of his works is worth considering in more detail.\nFirst, to develop the idea of the punning associations already referred to in relation to the term ultramarinos , there is the pleasing assonance between the name of this earthly Queen Mariana, and that of Maria, Queen of Heaven.\nThe Virgin has always been more popular than Christ in the New World; indeed in the sixteenth century certain churchmen had argued that while the East was the domain of Christ, the newly discovered West was that of his mother.\nOnce in America, however, Maria soon fragments into numerous different Marias, each with her own distinctive attributes.\nIn Mexico, during the Wars of Independence the Virgin of Guadalupe protected the nationalist forces while the Spaniards placed their trust in the Virgen de los Remedios.\nGironella's many versions of Velázquez's Mariana similarly fragment her into different roles — queen, woman, icon, cadaver, carnival figure, victim, aggressor.\nThere is a third sister in this euphonious family: Marina, the baptised name of Malinche, mistress of Cortèz, through whose good offices and linguistic skills Mexico was conquered both for the Virgin Maria, and for Marina's royal ancestors.\nMarina is the original and ultimate traitor to her people, but as mother of the first mestizo she is also the mother of modern Mexico.\nMariana herself is remembered more as a name on a family tree than as a person.\nWife of Philip IV, she was also his niece; she had been betrothed to his son Baltasar Carlos but on his death at seventeen the King (her uncle) married her himself, and the only surviving son of this union was the cretinous Charles II, last of the Habsburg line.\nShe is also remembered because she was painted by Velázquez, although this is not unrelated to the family tree.\nVelázquez shaped the public image of this family for his own and for all subsequent generations, investing them with an extraordinary pictorial power and stability.\nHis portraits must in turn be considered an important constituent in their power, as compensation for their more corporeal weaknesses.\nWith hindsight it perhaps seems strange that one of the indisputably greatest figures in the whole of Western art devoted the better part of his life to sell-advancement, and to painting the King, his family, and their attendant dogs, dwarves and sycophants Certainly the irony of this, together with the fact that this inbred family of often considerable mental as well as physical fragility should have controlled the destiny of so vast an empire, is not lost on Gironella.\nfig. 7 .\nAlberto Gironella,Reina Mariana , 1962, object.\nPrivate collection.\nWe can read into Las Meninas such a view of the Habsburgs (Fig. 8): Philip IV and Mariana are merely reflections, living in a world of grotesquerie and make-believe; a tiny princess dressed as an adult with a skirt so stiff it makes her look as if she is on wheels, surrounded by curtseying maids, a dwarf, a midget, a huge dog with the ability to sleep through anything, and a great artist, aloof and all-powerful.\nSuch a view is of course anachronistic, but this is exactly the attraction of Gironella's reworkings — he can present us with shifting visions of the art of the past, from within and from without, exploiting contrary responses, period eye and innocent eye.\nNot surprisingly Gironella has returned over and again to aspects of Las Meninas and in particular to the portrait of the artist himself, the insider, the fawning courtier, the creator of icons.\nFestin in Palacio is one of Gironella's latter-day altarpieces, and a digest of elements from three paintings —Queen Mariana, Las Meninas and the portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano, popularly known as El Niño de Vallecas (Fig. 9).\nIn the lower register, on the altar frontal, the tilted head of Lezcano leers at us while, boxed up alongside, a disembodied head and a hand are presented as relics of Queen Mariana while above Velázquez himself, palette in hand, seems to fade into a dog.\nOn the altar table itself, in front of a piece of red damask, lies a large, realistically-modelled dog.\nThis is the dog from the foreground of Las Meninas , but here awake and ready for action, the centre of attraction and, apparently, the object of devotion.\nThe implications of Festin in Palacio are realised in a particularly horrific version of Queen Mariana of 1963,Perro devorando a la Reina Mariana (Dog devouring Queen Mariana) where she is set upon by hunting dogs who tear at her blood-red head gear (Fig. 10).\nDuring the conquest of the Caribbean the Spaniards trained packs of such dogs to kill Indians and so to wipe out whole villages.\nHere history is inverted: Mariana, Queen of the American Empire, is devoured by her own hounds.\nBut no simple anti-colonial reading of Gironella's work is possible, precisely because to denounce the \nFig. 8 .\nVelázquez,Las Meninas , 1656, oil on canvas, 318 x 276 cms.\nMadrid, Prado.\nFig. 9 .\nAlberto Gironella,Festin in Palacio , 1958, retable, 251 x 174 x 60.5 cms.\nCollection Maria Rodriquez de Reyero, Mexico.\nPhotograph, courtesy Galeria OMR, Mexico.\nSpanish past is to deny many of the elements which go to make up modern Mexico.\nThe Queen of Yokes is a good example in its complexity and range of reference (Fig. 11).\nHere again Mariana is pinned out flat, composed of disparate elements.\nHer wig is made up of bottle tops, left over from ordinary twentieth-century life, trodden into the dirt underfoot, pressed on to noticeboards.\nThe majority are painted yellow, the colour of the bottle tops on Superior , a light Mexican beer famous for its slogan ‘la rubia que todos quieren’‘the blonde which everybody loves/wants’, reducing Mariana to that Latin American cliché, the accessible, desirable, blonde foreign female.\nHer expression here is a mixture of naiveté and anxiety.\nHer carved wooden bodice suggests popular Mexican crafts, and particularly the calaveras , animated skeletons which make up her rib cage.\nThese are the central feature of the Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico, but then again skulls and skeletons are commonly used as emblems of the transience of life in seventeenth-century Spanish painting.\nThe gourd-breasts and the leather-thonged sorcerer's switch can be seen as referring to indigenous culture, as can the snakes' heads with which the yokes of her skirt appear to terminate.\nThe inclusion of these wooden yokes, the yugos of verbal associations and pun.\nThe word Yugo in Spanish, as in English, evokes different ideas:el yuqo colonial, el yugo matrimonial and el yugo de la iglesia , the colonial yoke, and the yokes of marriage and of the church, and all of these are implied here.\nMariana is yoked in an arranged marriage to her uncle, Philip IV; she, as representative of the Spanish crown, is also a representative of the colonial and religious yokes which bound Mexico to Spain.\nThe motif of the yoke was originally the emblem of Isabella of Castile, Mariana's distant predecessor, who had been responsible for sending Columbus on his first transatlantic voyage in 1492; in other words she had been responsible for initiating the whole colonial process (Fig. 12).\nIn the present century the combined emblems of Isabella's yoke (Y for Ysabella) and her husband Ferdinand's arrows (Flechas ) were expropriated by the Falangists in an attempt to claim some historical legitimacy.\nIn other words, verbally and visually the emblem of the yoke has strong resonances in Spain and Mexico.\nBut it is important that here the yokes are inverted: Mariana and the ties with Spain she represents have been transformed, translated into Mexican, into the  complexities of the mestizo Mexican present.\nShe is an essential but individually helpless cog in the colonial machine; she is pinned out like a pre-columbian sacrificial victim, bruised and blood-stained; she is a religious icon, like a popular image of the Virgin Maria; she is a mannikin from some popular religious festival.\nFig. 10 .\nAlberto Gironella,Perro devorando a la Reina Mariana (Dog devouring Queen

of Picasso.\nPicasso's extensive series of variations on Las Meninas was produced in 1957, but even if Gironella knew of them when he himself began to work on versions of Velázquez (which is highly unlikely, as Picasso's paintings were not exhibited until 1959); even though their interest in the art of the past at that point in their careers was for both, perhaps, a rejection of abstraction; and even though both can in some way be defined as exiled from their Spanish roots, as outsiders looking in —— yet the results are widely divergent.\nPicasso's paintings are principally explorations of, or developments of matters internal to Las Meninas:the light, the perspective, the angle of Mariana's head, the bobbing handmaids, echoed, for example, in the paintings of pigeons bobbing on his window sill, and so on .\nIn one version, for example, the odd position of Nicolas Pertusato's hands is rationalised by the addition of a piano.\nGironella is far removed from such light humour.\nEdouard Jaguer, when comparing the two, rather acidly remarks that ‘despite all the irritating virtuosity’ of Picasso's rendering of Delacroix or Manet or Velázquez, in the end they are one-dimensional.\nGironella is of course also interested in the formal qualities of these works, but it is the subject matter, the content, which really holds his imagination.\nDrawn to the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction aspects of Spanish history, Gironella found in Veláquez's portraits a perfect starting point for a detailed investigation of the contradictions which go to make up modern Mexico.\nHis preoccupations are unusual (if not unique, as he claims) but they are unquestionably engendered by the search for a cultural identity which lies behind so much of Latin America's greatest artistic and literary creations.\nAmbivalence towards European culture, doubts about the possibilities of finding an authentic voice, a restless search for confidence and self-esteem, these are among the many bitter fruits of colonial rule in Latin America.\nIn 1921, Siqueiros had urged artists to ‘avoid those lamentable archaeological reconstructions’(‘Indianism’, ‘Primitivism’, ‘Americanism') but he had also warned against the use of ‘archaic motifs’ from the old masters of European art ‘which for us would be exotic’; instead his advice was to study the arts of both, learning from the ‘constructive base’, the ‘great sincerity’, of the latter, and the ‘synthetic energy’of the former, to combine the ‘lost values’of the past with new values to produce an art appropriate to modern America.\nIt may not be quite what Siqueiros envisaged, but Gironella's is an authentically Mexican solution.\nFig. 12 .\nArrows and yoke emblem of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic Kings from Casa

ISBN 0 — 7456 — 0614 — 8. £8.95.\nWhat is it that makes this substantial book produce, mixed-in with its rewards and knowledge, a depressing effect?\nDoes it matter?\nCallinicos' own apology about publishing yet another study of an over-worked subject notwithstanding, it remains an important contemporary debate.\nIt isn't that; the more so since Callinicos' contribution contains a significantly original dimension.\nDespite its fashionable subject the book is in no sense routine.\nUncritical testimonials to the postmodern's attractions are ten a penny, and conservative denunciations thereof not much scarcer.\nThis study has the distinction of being both critical and radical, essentially turning the tables on advocates of the postmodern and reading their rhetoric as symptomatic of a conservative milieu's interests in a period of overall stagnation.\nIt is ‘of course’ unlikely that Callinicos' criticism will cut much ice with those whose substantial career investments lie in one or another of the postmodern's corners: movementist politics, the radical academy, post this-ism and that-ism, a variety of well-upholstered ‘dissenting’niches from both the dominant culture and traditional opposition to it.\nToo much is at stake for a book dedicated to proving the continuing value of classical Marxism to dislodge them.\nMaybe this is one reason for depression, then: that the book's well-wrought arguments will not exercise those whose ideology it dissects.\nThis indeed has already happened.\nCallinicos' Marxism has been repelled from the ramparts of pluralism for being…well, Marxist.\nIt leads to the Gulag, you know, and is patriarchal to boot(translation: Marx had a beard).\nGiven that Callinicos' book is difficult, and given the probability that despite the seriousness of its argument it is unlikely to be widely debated, I will firstly offer an interpretation of what I think its main themes are, and what they are not.\nIn the first place, as the title makes plain, if offers a searching criticism of the claim that we are living in a postmodern epoch, and the consequence of that claim, that the culture and politics appropriate to such an epoch are structurally different from those of the preceding — and now past — Modern one.\nCallinicos' criticism of the ‘postmodern’ hypothesis contains a range of emphases, the three principal ones of which are: First: advocates of the postmodern in art (which attains uncommon prominence in so far as the ‘postmodern’is powerfully underwritten by a claimed distinction from Modernism), tend to misread the modern and arrogate its defining characteristics to their own period.\nThe main ones of these are: the ordering concept of ‘doubling’—— double coding, the laying of one text over or against another; the relationship to historical codes of representation; and the relationship to popular codes of representation.\nCallinicos is able to set the claims of such postmodern advocates as Charles Jencks and Linda Hutcheon against an analysis of Modernism (predicated largely on that of Eugene Lunn) in order to demonstrate that the latter is a good deal more complex in respect of its characteristic conceptions of the subject, expression, reflexion etc, than the former are wont to have it.\nThis is so to the extent that the claim for a structurally distinct postmodernist mode of signification breaks down in the face of a variety of historical avant-garde practices ranging across Europe from London to Vienna and Moscow in the hands of such as Eliot, Joyce, the Cubists, Surrealists and others (including, somewhat surprisingly, Kokoschka).\nA further set of more qualified — or at least less wholesale — more ambiguous claims are then encountered, by authors such as Lyotard, Jameson and Lash.\nThese include: the postmodern as a tendency within the modern; a notion of the ‘sublime’ and postmodernism's related freedom from dependence on the concept of totality; a distinction between the postmodern conceived in terms of the externalised and impersonal as against a view of the modern as characterised by the internal and ‘impressionist’; and a claim that it is the characteristic of the postmodern to signify figurally rather than discursively (?).\nCallinicos' conclusion to these arguments is that despite their efforts, built around a claimed contrast of the postmodern either with or within Modernism, these authors have produced only ‘mutually and often internally inconsistent accounts’ of the ‘postmodern’, manifesting an ‘inability to come up with a plausible and coherent account of its distinguishing characteristics’(p. 28).\nIt is in fact Callinicos' later claim that, rather than occupying a qualitatively distinct position, ‘late capitalist culture represents a continuation of trends operative throughout this century’(p. 53).\nThe second main emphasis of Callinicos' critique is aimed at the philosophy most frequently regarded as underpinning claims for the distinction of a postmodern culture, viz. poststructuralism.\nDrawing on  his own previous work, as well as that of Dews and Habermas, the main thrust is initially to connect both ‘wings’ of poststructuralism — the ‘textualist’strand associated with Derrida, and the ‘contextualist/historical strand identified principally with Foucault — to the Nietzschean philosophical tradition; and then to isolate the most common problems attributed to that tradition to which,a fortiori , post-structuralism succumbs.\nThese concern: the subject; the issue of how critical resistance to dominant codes ever develops in the absence of an adequate conception of the subject; and, perhaps most fundamentally, the traditional problem facing any philosophy seeking to reduce knowledge to interests tout court , of using rational argument to prove the limits on rationality.\nThis is the densest, yet at the same time one of the most persuasive sections of the book, wherein a variety of arguments drawn from the analytic tradition are deployed against Nietzsche's lineage: Quine and Davidson on a theory of meaning both holistic and realist — demonstrating that there are more ways out of atomism and the myths of the given than Saussure's; and an anti-relativist notion of truth as a ‘regulative ideal’ derived from Tarski, Popper and Lakatos.\nThere is no space here, central though it is to Callinicos' argument as a whole, to do other than note how this perspective is then deployed not only to counter poststructuralism but also significantly to modify the position of its main critic, Habermas.\nIf Foucault and Derrida are taken to task for their Nietzschean lineage, Habermas' main weakness is deemed to lie in his Kantianism, manifest in a formalist ‘metaethics’, and his conception of ‘communicative rationality’ grounded in the consensual account of meaning offered by speech-act theory — and as such likewise vulnerable to Davidson, as well as to Wittgenstein.\nIn essence then, at this philosophical level, Callinicos is marrying historical materialism and analytical philosophy, as it were Marx and Wittgenstein, in order to defeat a range of new and old Idealisms: principally that tradition, dismissive of Enlightenment rationalism, descending from Nietzsche via Heidegger to a bathetic end in Lyotard and Baudrillard.\nCompelling as it is, however, this strategy does not form the conclusion of Callinicos' case.\nThe third main emphasis in his critique of the concept of the postmodern is to attempt to explain the hold exercised by a demonstrably deficient theory of culture and its dependence on a fundamentally irrationalist philosophy: which is to say he offers a politics of the postmodern.\nThere are two pillars to this account: the emergence in the post-war period, and more particularly in the last two decades, of a mass social layer analysable under the rubric of a new middle class — though internally much differentiated as well as distinct from a traditional petite bourgeoisie in respect of its structured ‘overconsumptionism’.\nAnd secondly, the defeat of the last major challenge to the system associated with the overdetermined name of ‘1968’ but finally petering out in the mid-1970s.\nThe latter is primary; the emergence, or at least acceleration, of the former a consequence of measures adopted by newly confident conservative states to cope with the re-entry of the world system into a succession of capitalist crises after the exhaustion of the Long Boom.\nThis kind of argument reads well in Callinicos' hands, but it is worth reminding ourselves of the unattractive reality to which it bears witness.\nA real tragedy has taken place.\nIf one only takes educational institutions such as universities and colleges, let alone the world outside, the emancipatory impulse of the sixties and early seventies has been turned inside out.\nWhat began as a compelling rejection of a straitjacketing orthodoxy made its criticism in terms of a materialist demand that the socio-political locale of culture be addressed, in the face of an institutionalised aversion to any such examination conducted under a self-serving misrepresentation of the autonomy of art.\nThis stance has now been inverted by a puritanical moralising clerisy which virtually polices conduct and enquiry in the name of a postmodern triptych — as Terry Eagleton has put it — of class and race and gender.\nWhat amounts to a fear of art, perpetrated under a false rhetoric of care and defence of the marginalised now dominates everything this oxymoronic ‘radical orthodoxy’ touches.\nAnd it touches a lot.\nMaking all due allowance for the return of historical tragedy as farce, watching this soporific monolith of the virtuous rise out of the debris of a liberating movement is akin to nothing so much as witnessing Bureaucracy emerge from the ashes of Revolution.\nIt is one of Callinicos' main concerns to relate the constellation of ideas and cultural practices trading under a conception of the postmodern condition to an inadequate and escapist politics: the claim, as one of his own critics has had it, that ‘the conditions that sustain oppression can be altered piecemeal’(Patton, cited, p. 85).\nCallinicos mordantly comments on the descent ‘from revolutionary groupuscule to single-issue campaigns and then to social democracy’.\nIn sum then, while acknowledging the stature of some elements of this constellation, such as the historical aspects of Foucault's work or the critical élan of Fredric Jameson (not to mention the giant figure of Habermas), Callinicos develops a root and branch assault on claims for the cultural distinction of the ‘postmodern’, for the conceptual adequacy of its theoretical base, and above all for the deleterious political consequences of adherence to it.\nSo far so good; or one might almost say, so unproblematic.\nCallinicos mobilises as powerful a body of argument and evidence as is readily conceivable against a variety of contemporary critics and theorists whose claims he sees, with justice, as a trahison des clercs .\nThus far there is something almost conventional about the book's stance.\nIt is possible — just — to imagine a relatively orthodox artist, critic or historian appreciating the demolition of postmodernism (if not the evidence of late capitalism's corruption and decay).\nBut this is not the argument's main thrust; and it is this rather elusive second aspect which gives the book its definitive character.\n‘Elusive’ isn't quite the word, however.\nIt is more a matter of approaching the book's arguments from within a milieu of relatively academic contemporary art theory and being unable to see the wood for the trees.\nFor the concomitant of Callinicos' critique of postmodernism is not, as it would be in half a hundred other cases, the defence of modernism.\nFor one thing, Callinicos goes out of his way to establish that the intellectual tradition he is concerned to critique is itself most fruitfully read, not as an articulation of a qualitatively new postmodernism, but an instance of a Modernist-type response.\nThus: ‘poststructuralism […$ the philosophical expression of Modernism, whose characteristic themes were indeed announced by Nietzsche’(p. 6); Nietzsche's ‘system of ideas’ is ‘in many respects a philosophical articulation of the main themes of Modernism’(p. 67).\nCallinicos is concerned to give weight to the proposition advanced by Franco Moretti in respect of Carl Schmitt, that it is not the task of Marxism to defend Modernism as if its devices were ‘inherently subversive of the existing social order’(p. 48).\nThe point is that for Callinicos, Nietzschean thought is an instance of Romantic anti-capitalism: that form of refusal of the implications of capitalist modernity which has been present virtually since the birth of that condition, described by Michael Lowy as ‘opposition to capitalism in the name of pre-capitalist values’(cited p. 67).\nThe consequence of this is that Modernism too must be a form of romantic anti-capitalism, and as such one-sided and vulnerable.\nThe principal weakness of both the modernist tradition proper, and indeed of Nietzsche himself is, for Callinicos, their aestheticism.\nIt is as well to be clear on this.\nCallinicos' defence of classical Marxism, of historical materialism, is in the first instance deployed against a postmodernism which has come to proclaim the death of the grand narrative of emancipation and the need for a new form of politics not constructed along the lines of the traditional left.\nThis defence of Marxism carries over, however, to a critique of Modernism itself: not merely for the fact that Nietzsche attaches ‘importance’ to art but for the further claim ascribed to him, and therefore to Modernism itself, that ‘the nature of aesthetic experience contains in nuce the form of understanding proper to the world itself (p. 66).\nIn the end, that is, Callinicos pits historical materialism against not merely postmodernism but, following the logic that the latter is indistinguishable from Modernism properly conceived, against Modernism itself.\nDrawing largely on the Marshall Berman/Perry Anderson debate, and thereby making of Modernism the characteristic expression of the experience of modernity, itself conceived as a response to capitalist modernisation, Callinicos seems to want to claim in essence that both the former are partial in respect of the fact of this last.\nWeber's conceptualisation of the modern as a process of structural differentiation is, I think, seen to be echoed in Modernist claims for the specificity of art.\nBoth are then held to be deficient relative to Marx's conception of a ‘mode of production’within which differentiation can be understood, made intelligible and ultimately accountable to a materialistically grounded ethics of emancipation rooted in a conception of a ‘complex’ totality.\nIt is in connection with this perspective that Callinicos was concerned to deny the common conflation by postmodernists of Modernism with the Enlightenment.\nFrom his point of view, Modernism as a sub-species of romantic anti-capitalism is one partial moment in the rejection of the consequences of Enlightenment properly understood: understood, that is, in terms of a Marxism which is itself held out as the genuine heir to the Enlightenment narrative of emancipation and its romantic critique.\nHere lies the root of Callinicos, project — the buttressing of Marxism as the ‘true radicalisation’ of the Enlightenment; and here I suspect lies also his ultimate discomfort with Modernism — prone as it is to slip the leash of a guiding politics and dance under the less biddable star of the Aesthetic.\nAt this point Callinicos has to be careful: it is one thing to dismiss the claims of a rootless postmodernism, wandering naked except for its designer trainers across the face of a barren late capitalism.\nIt is quite another also to offer a wholesale refutation of Modernism.\nAnd Callinicos is aware of this: ‘Is not the general tendency of this analysis similar to Lukács' celebrated denunciation of Modernism as ‘aesthetically appealing, but decadent’?(p. 53).\nFor fairly obvious reasons, mostly no doubt connected with the spectre of Zhdanov and Socialist Realism (but also I suspect because of a more subterranean philosophical linkage between Callinicos' endorsement of Althusser's ‘complex totality’ against Lukács' ‘expressive totality’and the political voluntarism which it informed in the early twenties), Callinicos has to answer: No.\nThis begins to be interesting, and it is I think the originary focus of that sense of misgiving with which I began.\nIf I have been primarily expository hitherto (and I have been because I believe Callinicos' book to be the best on this subject that we have) I will now begin to turn to criticism; or at least to trying to ventilate that reservation which, faced by Callinicos, certainty, will not be stilled.\nIn a sense it doesn't matter if Callinicos' defence of Marxism is registered or not by the legion of Post-isms and -ists which form the undergrowth of contemporary cultural politics.\nThey will wither at the first frosts anyway, if they come; and if they don't…\nBut with his placement of Modernism in the lineage of Nietzsche, and as such at odds with Marx  and Freud as the real motors of that ‘true radicalisation of the Enlightenment’(p. 120) which is the only way ahead, something more serious is at stake.\nTo backtrack a little, the case is perhaps not so monolithic as I have implied: for which we have to return to the detail of Callinicos' ‘No’ to Lukács.\nOn the one hand — and this is a point to which I shall return — there is a dual claim against Lukács' evolutionism (to the effect that different levels of a social formation are relatively autonomous: crudely, if bourgeois society is decadent this does not necessarily mean, as Lukács thought it did, that its art is too), and in favour of the possibility of being able to pass a positive ‘aesthetic judgement’ upon a particular work however questionable the general category under which it has been produced (a position related to Brecht's polemic against Lukács).\nMore empirically however, on the other hand, and drawing upon the work of Peter Bürger, Callinicos accepts the case for Modernism having contained a critical moment — a ‘protest against the capitalist society to which it is in complex ways related’(p. 53).\nThis is principally indexed to the claimed historical transformation of Modernism into a series of engaged avant-gardes dedicated not to the aestheticisation of life, but to the integration of art into life.\nAs Bürger has it: ‘Aestheticism had made the distance from the praxis of life the content of works.\nThe business of the new configuration was different: art ‘transferred to the praxis of life’— not however ‘to integrate art into this praxis’ but ‘the attempt to organise a new life praxis from a basis in art’(cited p. 54).\nThe ‘avant-garde’ here means, of course, constructivism, surrealism and a range of Weimar practices grouped by Callinicos somewhat misleadingly under the label ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’.\nJust how remote this stance in fact is from the aesthetic is a matter for further debate, but it is perhaps worth interpolating that the implied valorisation of the products of these engaged avant-gardes as a function of their engagement is defeasible.\nContra Buchloh et al .,\nas well as Callinicos, there is nothing as far as art (as distinct from culture or politics) is concerned which will a priori privilege a Tatlin made in revolutionary Petrograd from a Matisse painted in a hotel bedroom on the Riviera — Benjamin on technique notwithstanding (don't forget: Benjamin owned a Klee).\nBe that as it may, these avant-gardes are held to have a ‘distinctive character’ which resides in their ‘seeking to abolish the separation between art and life’.\nFor Callinicos this is ‘unquestionable’; as is the fact that the shift is enabled by the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.\n(These arguments owe much to Perry Anderson's location of the tripartite enabling conditions of the Modern movement as: a decrepit academicism; the presence of new technologies; and ‘the imaginative proximity of social revolution’.)\nFor Callinicos it is October which made the vision of social transformation ‘concrete’.\nThe downside of this, so to speak, is that the defeat of October's aspirations also marks the avant-garde's defeat.\n‘Between them Stalinism and Nazism destroyed the avant garde.\nThe political defeats of the 1930s ‘shipwreck’ the avant-garde, and furthermore, through a kind of extension (since one assumes Anderson's tripartite conjuncture fuelled even those Modernist forms which did not quite take the transformatory step into engaged avant-gardism) come to determine ‘the more general exhaustion of Modernism’.\nThe end of the Second World War is marked by the incipient commodification of social life, and as such ‘the disintegration of the Modernist conjuncture’(pp. 60 — 1).\nThe problem then begins to stand clear and I shall now have to be brief and schematic.\nCallinicos drives a coach and horses through postmodernism; well and good.\nBut the roads on which he drives it also go through most of the art produced in the last half century — shall we say for the sake of convenience, since the death of Trotsky; or in a more apt frame of reference, since Guernica ?\nI will simply have to state the case dogmatically, but: this is untenable.\nAll of Callinicos' philosophical sophistication and matchless political experience evaporate in the face of the art of his own lifetime.\nAside from the fact that he doesn't actually discuss it in any detail, there is little more than a disappointed huffing and puffing at the exhaustion of the avant-garde's shock value (backed up by a particularly crass quotation from Peter Bürger about Duchamp's readymades) and some utterly routine panting over the outlandish prices being currently paid for Van Goghs — plus a quotation from a sub-Warholian Manhattan ‘artist’ answering an art magazine questionnaire with a few smart remarks about business and producing art for the market.\nas if this were adequate to underwrite a claim for the avant-garde's loss of critical virtue.\nIn an extraordinary passage towards the end of the book, amplified in discussion at Marxism 90 in a debate specifically convened to discuss Modernism and Postmodernism, Callinicos described his experience of walking around an art gallery: ‘I have often been struck by the tedium that overcomes one while walking through a gallery of twentieth-century painting arranged in chronological order as one moves from the excitement of the early part of the century to the desperate and all too frequently sterile iconoclasm of recent artists' (p. 161).\nThe specifics aren't clear, but the contextual indications are that this would include American art from say, Pollock to André, not to mention a range of contemporary work on commodification stemming from Warhol.\nAll of which says more about Callinicos, and the limits on his knowledge and interests, than it does about the work.\nWhither Brecht now, on the lure of the good old days; not to mention the nostalgia laid at the door of romantic anti-capitalism?\nI shall conclude briefly.\nThe point is I think that the argument from here can go two ways.\nThe first response is that it doesn't matter very much.\nCallinicos, defence of Marxism is erudite and compelling, and the fact that he runs out of steam over post-war art is of less moment than the fact that he takes the range of issues seriously enough to discuss them at all.\nMost sociologists, economists and politicians, after all, don't get that far.\nThe second road is however rockier; and it is an undecided question whether its implications are depressing and frightening, or challenging and exhilarating.\nCallinicos is very careful to say, in at least two places in the book, that aesthetic judgement as to the value of a work of art is at least relatively independent of the cultural and philosophical critique of the bases from which it proceeds.\nThus, in his discussion of Modernism relative to Lukács and Brecht: ‘to highlight the fact that Modernism shares with Romanticism a ‘subjectified occasionalism, is not thereby to pass a negative aesthetic judgement on the works of art grouped together under the former label.\nBrecht's polemic (i.e. against Lukács)[…]retains all its force today’(p. 53).\nAnd again á propos Postmodernism: ‘Nor does the argument set out in this section imply the dismissal of all recent works — including those described as ‘Postmodern’—— as worthless rubbish.\nGood art can be produced in an immense variety of different conditions’(p. 161).\nThis magnanimity is precisely the problem.\nThe traffic is all one way.\nCallinicos appears to think that he can detect ‘aesthetic merit’ from the position given to him by his politics; politics, writ large, as embodying an ethics and a philosophy, is the active force.\nThus post-Second World War art is as it is —— with an ‘emphasis on the autonomous and abstract work of art’(p. 154)— allegedly because of the ‘effects’ of the stabilisation and extension of capitalism.\nCause and effect: what took place was a ‘flight into abstraction’.\nThis is a language, a world view, a form of life perhaps, wherein one of the principal reasons for according praise to a type of art is that it is able to give voice to a politics; Bolshevism in the main case, though as Callinicos acknowledges, one of the salient points about Modernism was its ‘ambiguity, its capacity to express a variety of different political positions’; that is, when it was not engaged on its more usual ‘flight from politics’(p. 161).\nArt, it seems, is the perpetual recidivist, always ducking back into the aesthetic as soon as vigilant life averts its gaze.\nWhen times are bad and reactionary commodification sets in, the deleterious upshot is ‘the recuperation of the avant-garde for art’(p. 157).\nWhen things are on the up and the lodestar of a transformatory politics shines bright, so too does ‘the avant-garde project of overcoming the separation of art and life’(p. 171).\nIn this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art.\nThe individual ‘good’ work might get thrown up, however unpropitious the circumstance.\nBut it can only be a quirk; and the force of its ‘goodness’ is strictly limited and circumscribed.\nOnly once, in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot, of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology.\nBut even this is done in the name of a supposed ‘immediate sensuous charge’ rather than any more extended critical capacity of art or the aesthetic.\nOf course, the whole thrust of the historic avant-garde, and particularly its celebration here, lies in its being associated with a liberation from bourgeois ideology; but this is not quite the same as having your revolutionary commitments tested by your aesthetic judgement.\nFor by far the greater part, the aesthetic is bracketed in the name of a robust historical materialism.\nAnd there is no room for doubt as to which is the tail, and which the dog.\nWalter Benjamin once implied something rather different.\nSpeaking against social realism in ‘The Author as Producer’, he identifies a work's ‘political tendency’ and its ‘literary tendency’.\nThe relationship he postulates is not one-way traffic; it is dialectical.\nA work ‘can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct’.\nI take this to mean that there is an equality, a reciprocity between the aesthetic and the political such that an aesthetic dimension or response can give the lie to a political claim.\nThe point of Benjamin's article seems to be to decentre the political, or at least to subject it to test, to remove those making claims for their political correctness from their habitual position of judge and jury: such that the art can, in principle, sort out the politics, and not just vice versa.\nIt is this, in the end, which I find disquieting about Callinicos' book.\nNot the vapidity of the postmodern which it reveals.\nBut the way in which the very limits of its historical materialism (which I take to be the most developed statement of the case available in English) put back on the agenda questions one had considered closed.\nThe critique of Nietzsche's apocalyptic aestheticism, with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius, just cannot be reduced to the cliché about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes.\n(Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate?\nAt least you would have to be a doctor to say so, and not a politician or an academic.)\nA requirement to minimise, even to trivialise the aesthetic — one might almost say, a fear of the aesthetic — is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here.\nThere is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic.\nBut a tame aesthetic is no friend of historical materialism.\nArt has to be more than an ornament, or a reinforcement.\nThere has to be the possibility that the politics can be put at risk by the aesthetics, or the relationship as well as each of its components will be inert.\nAn unpredictable aesthetic, it could be said, is a requirement of an historical materialism adequate to its political task.\nIf the aesthetic is genuinely to  have reciprocal leverage upon the political, certain problems have to be faced.\nFor example, what goes on when looking at, say, a Matisse in an art gallery.\nIt is easy to say that the time spent considering the Matisse is time better spent than that spent considering a Gerasimov, let alone a Bouguereau.\n(It is a terminal problem with the race n'class n'gender triptych that all these transactions are equivalently sociological.)\nBut what of time spent otherwise?\nHow to adjudicate?\nThe problem of course goes inescapably to a notion of the quality of experience (though what we are calling the aesthetic here is not, or not only, a question of intensity).\nThe relationship between, say, reading an article in Socialist Review on the bureaucracy's pursuit of revenge on Arthur Scargill, and what it is that can be got from staring at Rembrandt's nose in a late self-portrait just is open.\nOne is not a priori more important than the other.\nWhich is also to say that it is not the case that there is no connection, or that a category mistake is involved in the mere comparison.\nThe information about Arthur should bear upon how one regards the Rembrandt.\nBut the way Rembrandt's nose is worked should equally provide a corrective to rhetoric or elision in the writing on bureaucracy.\nWhich is to say, the political commentary is a form of writing.\nOr, to use an unfashionable term in these linguistic days, of thought.\nAnd it is of the utmost importance to realise that the pragmatic answer to these questions is itself what makes the revolution never happen.\nWhich latter is not however to say that ‘correct thinking’ overturns society.\nThought and organisation, or aesthetics and politics, must circle each other warily, the one never letting the other out of its sight.\nThe abyss which all this opens up is, perhaps, terrifying before it is ‘depressing’.\nI have mentioned Walter Benjamin here.\nCallinicos concludes his book by invoking the memory of Benjamin to the effect that socialist revolution in the form of an irruption into history is the secular vehicle of a redemption hitherto conceivable only in mystic terms.\nFor Callinicos it is a belief in this possibility, and that alone, which remainders melancholy and irony — that is to say, Modernism — as an adequate response to modern life.\nIt is the consequence — presumably unintended — of his argument, however, that it demonstrates so irrevocably how much this is a matter of commitment and as such beyond the reach of proof.\nOne could say that the pressing question is how it is possible to live, rather than what teleology to adopt; or at least that the latter does not sort the former out.\nBenjamin remarked, tellingly, that it is less a question of what a man's beliefs are than the kind of man those beliefs make of him.\nThis is no less an aesthetic matter than a political one.\nCallinicos, in his haste to counter aestheticism, reduces the aesthetic.\nHe has to.\nYet the aesthetic will not be reduced.\nIt is not the means to an end conceived elsewhere: but an ‘as if ’, no less substantial than the as if of revolution itself.\nValue, you say?\nPushkin eating cherries before a duel; Lenin working day in day out on Iskra; one sentence or a newspaper (the point is of course, not one without the other); Benjamin on the requirement to denature your work ‘like ethyl alcohol’ lest it be of use to the other side.\nFor revolutions may occur, but the belief that they will does not of itself ensure a better lived life.\nAs to truth and beauty — the truth can doubtless be beautiful, though it need not be.\nCertain kinds of one-way traffic, certain kinds of one-way street, are in the end not hard to negotiate.\nTheir avoidance may be more difficult by far.\nAnd there is always the possibility — the necessity?— that beauty can be its own truth.\nLike taking poison on the border.\nTHE ART OF SCIENCE\nGEOFFREY CANTOR\nThe Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat, Martin Kemp, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1990. pp. viii — 375; 554 black and white illustrations — 16 colour plates.\nISBN 0 — 300 — 04337 — 6. £49.\nIn a heady essay written over thirty years ago, Giorgio de Santillana argued that some of the key ideas of the Scientific Renaissance were to be traced to developments in the arts.\nIn particular, the idea of space was transformed from the Aristotelian conception — a ‘tidy arrangement of a simple multiplicity of things, not unlike, let us say, the shipping department of SearsRoebuck-— into ‘a matrix for infinite potential complexities and states and tensions’.\nThe main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists, especially Alberti, Brunelleschi and Leonardo, who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space.\nWhen I first encountered de Santillana's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive.\nIts attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message, for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science.\nThey had argued that the new ideas about space and motion had arisen from an intellectual and, to a much lesser extent, empirical critique of the preceding, largely Anstotelian, notions.\nDiscussion of this transformation was confined to the great tradition of philosopher-scientists beginning with Aristotle, continuing with medieval authors, such as Oresme and Jordanus, and ending with Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and, of course, Newton.\nDe Santillana offered a very different account of the new ideas of space and a different cast of actors.\nMost importantly, he claimed that the new science was not the progeny of earlier science but the outgrowth of developments in the practical arts.\nIn his account the history of art and the history of science were intrinsically linked: in the late 1960s this was an heretical claim to most historians of science (and probably many historians of art).\nAlthough sympathetic to this heresy I found myself intoxicated but also somewhat inhibited by de Santillana's impressionistic style.\nHowever exciting his paper, his thesis seemed in danger of crumbling if it were reworked into a conventional historical discourse.\nIn the book under review, Martin Kemp reexamines the art-science relationship with much care and circumspection.\nHis style is lucid and he emerges as an honest broker who judiciously weighs the historical evidence.\nHe has an impressive command of the literature of both art and optical science across much of Europe and over a span of four centuries.\nIn contrast to de Santillana's uninterrupted thirty pages of text, Kemp's thesis is amply illustrated with several hundred plates, including many of his own line drawings showing artists' deployment of visual angles, vanishing points, etc.\nThe reader is led gently through the history of art and the details of optical science to appreciate their interrelationship.\nAlbeit less impressionistic and insightful, Kemp's analysis is of broader scope and greater clarity than de Santillana's.\nKemp identifies optics as a topic of common concern to both art and science.\n(In a sequel he proposes to pursue the role of anatomy and natural history in the history of art.)\nOf the many interweaving strands within this extensive topic he concentrates primarily on the way artists have deployed scientific ideas and instruments — these connections constitute ‘the science of art’ of his title —— while he also encompasses a number of related themes.\nThe science of art, claims Kemp, has not been adequately appreciated by art historians and to begin to rectify the situation he strives to demonstrate that ‘there were special kinds of affinity between the central intellectual and observational concerns in the visual arts and the sciences, in European history between the Renaissance and the nineteenth century (p. 1).\nIn the first of the book's three sections Kemp examines the theory and practice of perspective from Brunelleschi to Turner.\nThe second section, which is less focused and less easy to characterise, contains discussion of perspective machines and other technical aids as well as theories of perception.\nThe final section is concerned with the theory and depiction of colour.\nIn the first section one of Kemp's main themes is the relationship between theoria and praxis.\nRenaissance artists confronting the problem of portraying spatial arrangement, responded by developing linear perspective.\nThe initial emphasis was on praxis.\nFollowing the first crude attempts by Giotto, Lorenzetti and others, Brunelleschi got it right.\nThen, in the mid-1430s, Alberti the theorist codified the system.\nThe basic rules of linear perspective were now accessible to any artist.\nTheoria could influence praxis.\nThe relation between the theory and practice of  perspective over the next four centuries is examined in detail.\nTextbooks flourished making the rules of perspective available to aspiring artists.\nCodifiers produced ever more elaborate schemes for the depiction of spatial arrangements, often thereby rendering their work incomprehensible to the practising artist.\nArtists, architects and draughtsmen experimented with the new schemes since the theory of perspective offered exciting possibilities to depict the spatial relations between bodies.\nThus the eye could be subjected to precise ‘reality’, or it could be repositioned, led, titillated or deceived.\nSome of the most fascinating material in this book is provided by the uses of perspective to create illusions — such as Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi (1465 — 74) and Pozzo's dome of San Ignazio (1685).\nMoreover, Kemp hints at the diverse uses of perspective which offer a rich commentary on European history.\nIn the third and final section of the book Kemp addresses the use and theory of colours.\nHe argues that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries many artists adopted versions of the Aristotelian theory which asserted that colours are a mixture of black and white in different proportions.\nThey also often used constructively the analogy between colours and the harmonic scale.\nHowever, Newton's theory of light and colours, first published in 1672 and extended in his Opticks (1704), provided a new direction for colour theorists.\nIn opposition to Aristotle et al , Newton showed with his prism that white light is a mixture of its composite colours.\nMoreover, in the Opticks he identified seven colours in the spectrum and described a circle divided into seven segments that could be used to account for colour mixing.\nNewton's views were subsequently both elaborated and criticised.\nColour circles became ever more elaborate and orientated towards the practice of colour-mixing — witness those of Moses Harris (c. 1770) and Michel-Lugène Chevreul (1839).\nLouis Castel exploited the analogy between light and sound with his ‘Ocular clavichord’ and Goethe explored subjective colours.\nFor their part artists were experimenting and drawing on the insights provided by the colour theorists.\nDelacroix took Chevreul seriously.\nTurner, always alive to new ideas, responded creatively to both Harris and Goethe.\nSeurat paid close attention to both Helmholtz's Handbook of Physiological Optics (1867) and Ogden Rood's Modern Chromatics (1879) which, in turn, was based on James Clerk Maxwell's three-colour theory of vision.\nSuch a brief summary does not do justice to the detail and complexity of Kemp's argument.\nOptics provides a superb locus for examining the art-science relationship since optical problems, theories and constructions were integral to both science and art.\nTo admit that much is not to foreclose the question of defining that relationship since a nuanced understanding requires the command of historical detail that Kemp provides.\nViewed from the late twentieth century and the widespread acceptance of the ‘two cultures’, the search for affinities between art and science possesses particular significance for the historian.\nYet, by viewing history in this manner Kemp encounters an historiographical difficulty that he never satisfactorily resolves.\nThis problem surfaces even in his introduction in which he states that his concern is to show how artists ‘consciously aspired towards goals that we would now regard as scientific in a broad sense’(p. 1).\nPart of this passage has been italicised to draw attention to the somewhat presentist presupposition that underpins much of this book.\nIn qualifying ‘scientific’ by ‘in a broad sense’Kemp shows that he is aware of this problem.\nHowever, the presentist influence is all too pervasive.\nHis frequent appeals to ‘scientific concepts’ and ‘scientific ideas’often presuppose an unambiguous definition of science and one that is atemporal.\nThe difficulty is most apparent when discussing the Renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities Kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors.\nTake the example of Brunelleschi who, according to Kemp, introduced ‘scientific consistency’ into his use of perspective (p. 14).\nThe phrase suggests that Brunelleschi was engaging in an activity other than art.\nWas he doing science?\nAnd if so, would he and his contemporaries have recognised that in pursuing this consistency he was doing science, not art?\nAgain, how were science and art demarcated in the early fifteenth century —— socially, intellectually and institutionally?\nKemp's difficulty in defining ‘science’ and ‘art’is not confined to his discussion of the earlier period.\nFor example, in his appraisal of the eighteenth century he uses ‘scientific’ and ‘Newtonian’as predicates to create the impression of an hypostasised activity which stood separate from art and other aspects of Western culture, including philosophy.\nThus we are told that Brook Taylor, the author of the first major British work on perspective (1715), was ‘a professional Newtonian scientist’(p. 287).\nAlthough Taylor was active in the Royal Society, both predicates misrepresent this English gentleman who wrote extensively on mathematics and religion.\nLikewise, owing to his over-rigid use of categories, Kemp characterises David Brewster, the most eulogistic of Newton's nineteenth-century biographers, as an ‘anti-Newtonian’(p. 300).\nA related and equally significant problem arises from Kemp's search for causal historical relations between science and art.\nQuestions of historical influence feature prominently in this study.\nKemp frequently provides details of superficial social acquaintance between scientists and artists and refers to their reading habits.\nThis is, in one sense, unobjectionable and Kemp rightly weighs the evidence for influence circumspectly.\nHowever, the very preoccupation with identifying causal influences begs more fundamental questions about whether contemporaries shared intellectual assumptions.\nFor example, the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century was constituted not only by the new theories of Descartes, Galileo and Newton but also by new ways of experiencing the world, interacting with it and thinking about it.\nAccording to this claim, the mores of the eighteenth century were radically different from the sixteenth.\nYet this difference is somewhat obscured in Kemp's analysis by his concern to explicate the details of numerous perspective schemes and the techniques employed by artists.\nHe thereby pays less attention than he might to interpreting the science of art as a cultural phenomenon.\nIdeological and philosophical issues receive inadequate attention and yet these could have helped define the common context (or, perhaps, the contrasting contexts) in which art and science were pursued.\nAgain, Kemp's subject raises important questions about the structure and function of institutions which he only engages parenthetically.\nMore generally, a less causal and more structural approach might have been fruitful in illuminating the historical conditioning of the science of art.\nAnother example of a terminological difficulty arises in the section in which Kemp briefly examines the relation between perspective and eighteenth-century theories of perception.\nUnfortunately he predicates his discussion on the contrast between ‘empiricists’ and ‘nativists’, a distinction he soon recognises as inadequate.\nIn the light of Kemp's historiography, it is not surprising that he concludes that ideas about perception (which were often explicitly discussed by ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers') had little impact on artists (p. 237).\nWhile he has usefully identified theories of perception as an aspect of the science of art, they deserve a more eclectic and sustained analysis.\nLet me therefore mention briefly some further dimensions of the subject.\nMany artists, scientists and philosophers engaged the question of whether linear (or any other) perspective provides the true account of how we perceive.\nFor some authors perspective provides both the laws of perception and also the key to the true and rational representation of objects.\nLearn perspective and you can imitate nature precisely.\nHowever, many artists seriously questioned this wisdom.\nIn their art they combined perspective with drawing ‘by eye’; they instinctively knew when to follow the rules and when to break them.\nThis, for Kemp, is an important clue to the success of Velázquez and Turner for whom perspective was a useful servant but a poor master.\nBut artists were not alone in considering and debating the truth and limitations of perspective.\nA related point on which most (but not all) physical scientists (or, more appropriately, natural philosophers) of the seventeenth century would have agreed, was the primacy of mathematics in analysing the physical universe.\nTheir reasons for adopting this view differed somewhat, but we can take Galileo's position as not atypical.\nEchoing Plato, Galileo claimed that God had created the world according to mathematical proportions.\nThis implied that only in the sphere of the mathematical sciences can the human intellect attain knowledge that is as objective and as certain as it is known to the divine mind.\nThrough mathematics truth and reality could be laid bare and appearances transcended.\nThis metaphysical commitment came under scrutiny not only from those artists who refused to be limited by the laws of perspective but also from ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers’.\nOne of the most forceful attacks was by George Berkeley in his An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision (1709).\nHere Berkeley argued strenuously against the view that we judge the distance of objects by means of lines and angles.\nAlthough most commentators have claimed that Berkeley's principal opponent was Descartes, whom he cited as an example only in the second (1710) edition, he was more generally denying the widely-received assumption that we see according to the laws of geometry — this assumption being central to the perspectivist tradition.\n(Berkeley was familiar with perspective machines, one of which he described in a later work.)\nInstead, Berkeley sought to show that we learn to judge the distance, magnitude and situation of objects.\nThis controversial book was widely discussed but whether it was read by artists I leave to further research.\nBerkeley was not alone in questioning whether geometrical methods are adequate to account for visual perception since there was a large literature on the subject by ‘scientists’ and, as Kemp shows, artists also frequently commented on it.\nOne of the leading problems in this area was the horizontal moon illusion: the moon appears larger near the horizon than in its zenith.\nSince Ptolemy tried to solve this problem in the second century, it has been on the agenda of theorists of perception and is still, I understand, not fully resolved.\nIn the eighteenth century it was one of the main test cases for the dominance of geometry.\nAttacks on geometrically-based theories of vision (together with the deployment of such examples as the horizontal moon illusion) provide a theme of common concern to artists, scientists and philosophers and deserve further analysis than Kemp offers.\nIf there are aspects of the science of art that Kemp fails to engage adequately, the scope of this book is nevertheless very impressive and a number of the issues he discusses impinge on my concerns as an historian of science.\nLet me allude to two of these issues.\nIn the history of science theoria has usually been accorded far greater importance than praxis.\nThe general view has been that theoria is the engine driving the historical development of science and that praxis is merely the application of theoria.\nAlthough some historians, often Marxists, have rejected this consensus, only recently have aspects of praxis, such as laboratory skills, been subjected to close and sustained study.\nIn this respect the  historian of science has much to learn from an art historian like Kemp.\nMoreover, the analysis of skills provides a common topic of research for both art and science historians.\nThe second issue concerns the art-science relationship which Kemp analyses through the history of perspective and of colour.\nThe latter case is the more straightforward since he presents the impact of Newton's theory of coloured light as radically reorientating this area.\nWith perspective, the key figures of the Scientific Revolution are presented as the heirs to developments in art.\nFor example, we encounter Galileo as a bit-player who corresponded with Lodovico Cigoli over his lunar and sunspot observations.\nMore particularly, Galileo used standard perspective procedures in accounting for the foreshortening of the spots which he claimed in 1613 were on the surface of the sun.\nUnfortunately Kepler receives even less attention.\nYet in 1600 Kepler made important contributions to optical science, especially to the theory of image formation.\nKepler's concern with the formation of images was a response to a practical problem.\nHe noticed that when viewed with a camera obscura the image of the sun was too large but this enlargement was not explained by existing theory.\nInstead, he conceived every illuminated point being the source of rays spreading in all directions; a bundle of these rays (rather than a single ray) pass through the hole in a camera obscura(or the pupil of the eye).\nThus the image is enlarged owing to the finite size of the hole.\nIn his resolution of the problem Kepler represented his rays by strings.\nFor example, in ascertaining the image of a book on a distant plane, he adopted a procedure familiar to artists for almost a century.\nHe used a stretched string to plot ray paths that just grazed the book in their transit from the source of the screen.\nThis method of repeatedly deploying a stretched string to plot the light rays and thus ascertain selected points on an image was incorporated into the perspective machines described by Leonardo and Dürer.\nWhile the example of Kepler illustrates the influence of artistic practice on a ‘scientist’(which is not Kemp's primary concern), discussion of this instance would have enhanced considerably the author's argument that both the theory and practice of perspective were significant resources for the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century.\nHe also argues that, in its turn, the Scientific Revolution had some effect on the visual arts.\nMilitary engineers, who were also often mathematicians, such as Simon Stevin and Girard Desargues, contributed significantly to the subject of perspective.\nNewton is portrayed as influencing eighteenth-century perspective in an unspecified manner, although his effect on colour theory is seen as considerable.\nHowever, on Kemp's account few artists took notice of the philosophical, mathematical and scientific innovations of Descartes and Kepler.\nBy the eighteenth century there was a considerable parting of the ways since the more erudite mathematical treatises on perspective, such as those by Lambert and Monge, were of no use to the practising artist.\nEven optical instruments, such as perspective machines, the camera obscura and the camera lucida, were used sparingly.\nIt appears that once science gained its independent identity, scientists and artists used perspective for increasingly different purposes.\nAs with de Santillana's innovatory essay Kemp's book not only offers new ways of understanding the history of science and the history of art but it also raises a host of historical and historiographical questions.\nThese questions in turn suggest further lines of research that deserve serious attention by historians of both science and art.\nKemp has performed a valuable service in opening up this area.\nI hope other historians will now follow his lead.\nON

(sandpaperback)\nOn the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time.\nThe Situationist International 1957 — 1972, edited by Elisabeth Sussman, The MIT Press/ICA, Boston, Massachusetts, 1989, 200 pp.\nISBN 0860919838. £19.95.\nI\nThese books are both related to the exhibition On The Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Period of Time presented at the Musée national d'art moderne-Centre Georges Pompidou, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts during 1989 — 90.\nThe exhibition was conceived and realised by Mark Francis and Peter Wollen with Paul Hervé Parsy.\nFrancis and Wollen have also contributed articles (one each) both of which appear in both books as introductory statements on the Situationist International.\nBoth books are anthologies of materials by a large number of contributors.\nTheir titles invoke the Situationists' rhetorical use of long and rhapsodic titles.\nThey also denote deliberate obfuscations deriving from Dada and Surrealism.\nOn the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time (henceforth ‘the Boston text') is a film title used by Guy Debord in 1959.\nThe Situationist Scrapbook includes only two synoptical essays, the rest being made up of a selection of documents produced in various parts of Europe and Britain from the fifties to the eighties, some of which predate the founding of the Situationist International (henceforth the ‘SI').\nThese are followed by documents relating to the SI in Britain which include Ralph Rumney's Psychogeographic Map of Venice (1957), and brief statements by Michèle Bernstein which appear in the British press in the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe greater part of the Scrapbook largely consists of what the editor identifies as ‘the British inheritance’ which covers the period from 1966 — 1988.\nThe book is therefore very much an account of the movement's influence in Britain.\nThe Boston text relates more exclusively to the movement itself and includes, along with historical material, a brief statement by Mark Francis which is intended to justify and explain the motives behind the exhibition (the Situationists did not give the event their blessings and none of the past members participated in its planning).\n‘What we have sought to do’, claims Francis speaking for the organisers of the exhibition, ‘is not to reconstruct time past but to expose to the light things that have run the risk of acquiring the patina of nostalgia and the glamour of neglect.’\nIf this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the Situationist project and their condemnation of the art world.\nFrancis also implies, somewhat unconvincingly, that the event was conceived in a spirit of Potlatch and accepts the Lettrist belief in the legitimate use of plagiarism.\nThe Lettrists and the Situationists had used ‘pre-existing elements’ for their own ends, and so the editors of the Boston text and the curators of On the Passage have, they feel, a certain entitlement to do the same.\nThis legitimation in turn is related to the principle of détournement , a term which had been coined initially by the Lettrists for their neo-Dadaist practice of cannibalising pre-existent materials (in the manner of Duchamp's LHOOQ ) with subversive intent.\nMy view of the exhibition and these complementary texts is that they seem for the most part to lack the critical motivation and the dialectical irony of the Situationists.\nThey are normative representations, reverential in tone, recuperative in effect and the ideological positions which they reflect are conveniently distanced from those of the SI.\nSelf-evidently these texts are strikingly different from original materials issued by the SI in the sense that they have the status of copyrighted property and have been funded by organisations which in the past may have supported progressive art but which do not sound like the champions of revolutionary causes.\nThe Boston text, for example, is published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program, Massachusetts Council of the Arts and the Humanities, and additional funding is provided by the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund (the benefactor of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).\nThe Scrapbook is also variously supported by Association Française d'Action Artistique, the Ministry of Culture, Copenhagen, the Instituo Banco San Paulo of Turin, Becks Bier, to name some of the backers, and also by the furtively named Friends of the Situationist International, whoever they are!\nMore prosaically, the sandpaper cover (which, like the Jorn/Debord text Mémoires of  1959, is meant to damage your other books) was donated by English Abrasives and Chemicals Ltd.\nOne of the first ‘political’ statements in the Boston text is the copyright restriction notice.\nIt appears a few lines away from the plagiarised title of the book.\nThe proscription is, of course, a legal convention which we would normally take for granted, but is, in this context, inconsistent with the SI anti-copyright policy and, in the light of the Lautréamont axiom: ‘Plagiarism is necessary — progress implies it,’ which Francis cites on page 19, is an unintended irony.\nThe Boston text is more obviously an exhibition catalogue, if only because it includes a ‘checklist’ of the exhibition, which, ignoring the problematic identity of some of the works, distinguishes between works of art and other items (books, tracts, pamphlets, etc.) and also carefully identifies the status of individual exhibits by signifying their producer's relationship to the formally identified Situationist group.\nThere is another category for Situationist wannabees, which was an additional and problematical area of both books and the exhibition.\nSome of the materials in this area seemed to have the purpose of padding out the exhibition, whilst at the same time fulfilling the traditional function of consolidating the achievements of the founding group whose significance it was the purpose of the exhibition to celebrate.\nFrancis identifies the stages of the SI narrative as a chronological trajectory corresponding to (i) the Experimental Laboratory period;(ii) the detonator period (which refers to Debord's boast that he provided the explosive machinery that ignited in May 1968);(iii) the Fallout period after the SI disbanded in 1972.\nThese stages provide the logic for the ‘diachronic structure’ of the exhibition.\nIn the Fallout section are included artists, writers and others ‘who all had (sic) some contact with the SI’.\nPeriodisation and classification present some difficulties which Wollen hints at when he comments on ‘the ‘simulationist’ art boom of the eighties and its debt to the dry husks of Situationist thought’.\nIt is to be regretted that neither of these books examine the pluralism of the ‘simulationist’ period.\nTo the extent that the Situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the ‘supersession’ of art, how should we judge the Fallout period?\nThe notion of progression is clearly important in assessing this work, especially as the temptation to isolate, or even dismiss, it as an epiphenomenon of the SI is strong.\nThe materials displayed in the exhibition and reproduced in the Fallout section of the Scrapbook no doubt express ideas about which strong convictions are held.\nWhat are these convictions, and why are they not articulated?\nWhy were the exhibits left to speak for themselves?\nIt seems extraordinary that, given the political fervour of the Paris-based SI fraction in its post-Lettrist phase, the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to Debord's caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market.\nWhatever objectives the organisers might have had, the exhibition turned out to be a quite normative curatorial project.\nThe contradiction is perhaps a familiar one.\nAs Debord has commented: ‘This society signs a peace treaty with its most outspoken enemies by giving them a spot in the spectacle.'\nIt is noteworthy that the Situationists have produced nothing in the way of new projects for these texts, nor for the exhibition.\nPredictably they kept their distance.\nAt the centre of the re-grouped SI in 1961 Bernstein and Debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity.\nIt was at this time that Asgerjorn resigned his membership of the SI, although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s.\nThus re-grouped, the SI increased their political activity, eliminating all artistic production except in terms of agitational forms which meant, essentially, the use of détourné illustrations in their publications.\nThe article by Wollen is an important piece of research and a major contribution to both anthologies.\nDespite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject, it does, however, judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase.\nNevertheless, Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for André Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history.\nHe also traces the Hegelian, and Lukácsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual atmosphere after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists.\nApart from Wollen's historical and theoretical essay, the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin's ‘Dismantling the Spectacle: The Cinema of Guy Debord’.\nThis is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English.\nLevin makes a special case for Debord as a film-maker whose aim was to contribute to the ultimate destruction of cinema as a spectacularist medium.\nDebord's cinema for Levin is a paradigmatic vehicle for the movement's ‘destructive creativity’.\nThe main purpose of Levin's article, however, is to reclaim Debord for the aesthetic discourse of avant-garde cinema.\nFor example, he identifies Debord as the source of Godard's innovations: ‘Indeed, well over a decade before Godard's Vent d'Est , Debord was producing a revolutionary, materialist ‘counter-cinema’.’\nNot having seen Debord's films (he refused screenings at the ICA in London), Levin's arguments are in one sense untestable; nevertheless the article is not without difficulties.\nDefensively, he observes what he considers to be Debord's virtues and comments on the latter's avoidance of, as he puts it: ‘the various pitfalls — formalist essentialism, aestheticist myopia, politically naive fetishism of reflexivity, and so on, typical of certain avant-garde practices linked to radical political agendas.’\nNevertheless, Debord's place within a reified history of ‘political modernism’ is assured, more by virtue of what is claimed for the work than by its testing in public— Levin admits that screenings have been rare, especially outside France.\nBoth the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived.\nFurther to this, Levin claims that Debord ‘does not disparage pleasure’ and yet argues elsewhere in the essay that his films deliberately refuse to make concessions to the viewer.\nAn example of this is the early Lettrist film Hurlement en faveur de Sade , with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences.\nAs far as one can assess the merit of Levin's text in relation to its subject, it seems somewhat implausible that Debord can be all the things for which he is proclaimed.\nWhatever defence is mounted, it is clear that these films, for Levin, exist as auratic objects, and Debord their auraticised progenitor.\nHence the mythologisation of Debord by Levin, and others, has a significant bearing upon the reception of his work.\nHis remoteness and the scandal and intrigue associated with the SI have significantly contributed to the enhancement of the movement's reputation.\nLevin's essay, interesting though it is, achieves little more than assimilating Debord into the spectacularised history of the avant-garde cinema.\nHis hero-worship results in him reiterating the same claims that the cinéaste makes for himself.\nIn the opening sequence of Hurlement , as Levin notes, Debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated.\nThe tradition includes ‘great landmarks’ in film history from early ‘genre classics,(Levin's term), Expressionist, Dada, Soviet cinema of the 1920s, Surrealist, Chaplin, Lettrist and last, but not least, Debord.\nSituationist cinema is therefore important, indeed, self-important, not least because it provides ‘an alternative sort of cinematic activity, incompatible with the economy of the spectacle’.\nLevin earnestly considers Situationist film to be an effective oppositional practice.\nOne of the attractions for Levin is the persistency with which Debord, like the Dadaists before him, continued to explore the medium, whilst contributing to its eventual destruction.\nMoreover, Levin claims that the Situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions, ‘by consenting to act in culture’ as a precondition of their co-existence in the present order.\nNevertheless, cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in Levin's tribute.\nIt is like Hegel's notion of the beautiful soul which denounces the world from which it has withdrawn to avoid having to recognise the extent of its participation in its disorder.\nDebord, as a film-maker, and Levin, as his apologist, take refuge in the transcendental space of autonomy where meanings have the illusion of self-regulation and independence of the totality they represent.\nDebord takes up his place (certainly in Levin's account) within the lineage of modern masters with its attendant construction of patriarchy, distinction and causal succession.\nIn Levin's essay, avant-garde cinema is assimilated into the wider discourse of Modernist art despite their material and institutional differences.\nOne of the pitfalls of this is that different audiences and different modes of consumption are contingencies largely ignored.\nDebord's apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in Levin's emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history.\nThe blurring of art and film histories leads Levin into the murky waters of Situationist discourse on art.\nSuffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate, and lacks depth and clarity.\nDebord, for example, proclaims: ‘The critical position later elaborated by the Situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art.'\nThere is some sense in this comment which may well explain the position of the Situationists at a particular conjunction, but it is a sense which would also explain earlier avant-garde trends in art (if not cinema) since, say, Futurism.\nMoreover, the notion of art's ‘single supersession’, an histrionic claim, would benefit from some kind of historical and theoretical contextualisation.\nIt sounds important but in fact is an impenetrable statement.\nFurther clarification might also be required as to how the Situationist negation of art (and cinema) related to the wider sphere of cultural-political struggle.\nThe critique of art as an institution is continuous with earlier formations (including early Surrealism and Russian Constructivism), but Levin remains unclear in his definition of Debord's avant-gardism.\nFor Lukács and Adorno the concept of the avant-garde was a touchstone: for the one it was negative and decadent, for the other positive and progressive.\nIn Levin's account of Debord, his subject appears to hold both positions at once.\nMore specifically, on the issue of cultural hierarchies and class relations the Situationists tried to distance themselves from bourgeois notions of progress and their equivalence in the neo-avant-garde of the post-war period.\nThe SI thus rejected ‘mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession’.\nThis statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism out of which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it.\nIn fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified).\nHe does this by proclaiming, a ‘third avant-garde’, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the ‘two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord.\nHowever, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected  means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of art in the praxis of life might be achieved.\nThe reverential tone of Levin's text poses a problem which the movement's survivors, I imagine, would be quick to condemn.\nIt is, in short, uncritical in the sense of failing to site Debord's films within an adequate theoretical discourse.\nLevin objectifies his subject through the use of an argument which leaves the SI unexplained as a revolutionary organisation with the potentiality of reflecting, by its own methods, a radical social transformation.\nWhat he provides is the missing chapter in the secret history of the cinema, the missing link between Berlin Dada and postmodernism.\nAs with other contributors, exaggerated claims are made for détournement (the communication which contains its own critique), firstly because it was an inheritance from Cubism and Dada, and secondly, because, as the exhibition shows, its deployment by ‘pro-situs’ has made of it a commonplace, popularised in punk fanzines, and ‘Biff’postcards etc.\nThe Situationists' activities within the cultural sphere constituted an attempt to create a unified range of activities which functioned as a radical critique of the conventional boundaries between specialisations embedded in the institutions, practices and agencies of modern life.\nThe fragmented appearance of their work, especially its Lettrist phase, their repudiation of conventional skills and scholarly manners (evidenced in their use of personal insults) have been absorbed by subcultural milieux and in due course adapted by the culture industries.\nThe influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated (if overstated) in these books.\nIf the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed (SI through Fluxus, Heatwave, King Mob, Jamie Reid, Vivienne Westwood, and the Sex Pistols) the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence (typified by King Mob in Britain, the Motherfuckers in the USA, and also indirectly the punk phenomenon) but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life.\nThe political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large degree derives from Marx's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism, Lukács's development of this critique, and the Marxist-existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre.\nThe rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences.\nThe ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers' Council after World War One provided a ready-made model of a non-hierarchical political system.\nThe simple faith conveyed in Pannekoek's treatise recalls earlier utopian writing, and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of Situationist writing.\nWith the exception of Wollen, the contributors to the Scrapbook and the Boston text convey little concern for the forms of political organisation espoused by the Situationists, and it is perhaps symptomatic of their interest in the SI as a purely aesthetic phenomenon.\nThe SI clearly endeavoured to produce a revolutionary critique of modern life, and towards this end devised a convulsive rhetoric and an inventive vocabulary.\nThe revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this, rather than by its standing as a political organisation.\nThe remoteness of the movement from working-class experience guaranteed the survival of its bohemian image.\nIts re-emergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties Paris; a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names.\nThe Boston text reproduces old photographs of founding members.\nThe gamine looks of Bernstein and the neatness of Debord have an aesthetic relevance which signifies a rather vague, but nevertheless compelling, reason for their inclusion in the text.\nThey are not merely documentation.\nThey are in fact significant elements in the story of ‘Situationism’ which is the subtext of the book.\nThe political reticence evident in these volumes is indicated by a degree of randomness in the choice of materials and by implication a commitment to the more ‘expressive’ or irrationalist side of their work.\nIt is, for example, revealing that there is no indication in either book of the Situationist commitment to political struggles in the Third World and their critique of imperialism.\nThe introductions in both books are anodyne and brief.\nThe historical significance of the SI is not questioned, and the importance of the movement is asserted largely on the basis of aesthetic innovations which derive from the Lettrist period prior to the founding of the SI.\nDétournement and dérive (drifting) are thus reclaimed in terms of their contemporary relevance, or rather for the extent to which they influenced punk and the camp and erudite artistic radicalism which exploited it.\nWith the exception of Levin's extended analysis of film, neither the products nor any specific agitations of the Situationists and their epigones are subject to critical reassessment.\nThe short commentaries and comic imagery in the British section of the Scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions.\nSome of it is amusing, some of it pretentious drivel.\nClearly much of the material is unsupportable and there is a sense in which this is self-evident in that the Scrapbook is styled as an ‘anti-document’ which, like the films of Debord, is co-extensive with the equally unsupportable and qualitatively diminished world to which it relates.\nThe temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the Situationist project, it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal.\nThe  tendency is to ignore value distinctions and to undermine qualitative difference so that popular and high art genres are presented side by side in a unified space or text.\nThere is of course an inside knowledge which makes this ‘coherent’ for those in possession of it.\nThis presupposes the same audience separations, the same hierarchies, the same educational and class difference as before.\nFrank Mort has commented on this kind of separation between the new intellectuals who are happy and confident to mix genre and ignore qualitative and semantic difference ‘because they already know the map of Western culture’ and are distinct from those ‘who do not carry with them those levels of cultural capital.’\nHe adds to this: ‘In that sense postmodern discourse with its relativism, its denial of grand narratives and its refusal of questions of value, is a world tailor-made for the new metropolitan intellectual cadres.'\nIt therefore seems that ‘in a purely negative way’ the silence over the question of meaning in the Boston text and in the Scrapbook is perhaps not surprising —— it is an historically appropriate response to the disappearance of the SI.\n‘There is a sorrow in the Zeitgeist’ bemoans Lyotard, an inappropriateness in the metaphor of the ‘avant-garde’, and consequently a kind of absurdity attaching to the belief in art as a prefiguration of a global collectivist future.\nThat sorrow hangs over the discontinued struggles of the SI.\nThe belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear as if they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day.\nII\nWhat I have argued so far is that the Situationists are ill-served by these publications, and that this is partly due to the influence of a certain pessimism which haunts contemporary cultural politics.\nWhat I want to argue now is that there is a sense in which the symptom of this pessimism exist in the movement itself.\nThe Situationists were idealists in the sense that they perceived themselves apart from the spectacle, always managing to be ‘other-than-spectacular’, as Levin puts it, so that this became a pre-condition of Situationist practice.\nTheir self-image was that of the chosen few for whom the spectacle provided an inexhaustible supply of objects (and people) to hate, and whilst the apparent ease with which they targeted and disposed of their opposition often made good copy (the endless adventure, the scandal, etc.), there is a sense in which the hectoring tone of their documents became repetitive and wearisome.\nThe effusions of Vaneigem have an air of mystical revelation which is even more intense in recent publications.\nDebord's political fatigue is less evident but his filmwork has finished and he refuses to permit distribution and screening of his work in this medium.\nBernstein is now a journalist and works for a French newspaper.\nThere are, I think, just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook.\nThey appear in the documents section and therefore do not, we may take it, represent the views of the editors.\nFirstly, Art & Language's piece ‘Ralph the Situationist’ expresses considerable misgivings about the Situationist project: ‘The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating…’; ‘…bland incoherence — a self-contradictory absurdity — a moral ground to give up reading and remembering…’, and so on.\nWhatever gave Francis, or whoever it was, the idea that Art $ Language had anything to do with the Situationists?\nOn what basis is this reference made?\nThere is no evidence of SI influence in their work, which has quite different intellectual roots, and the article itself leaves no doubt as to the extent of their disapprobation.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of three early works by the group in the exhibition (dating from the late sixties) reveals a kind of make believe idea about an A $ L/SI connection.\nThere was no such connection.\nAs late as 1970 members of A $ L, to my knowledge, had never heard of Debord, and if they had were not the least bit interested.\nThe arbitrary inclusion of artworks in the exhibition is further evidence of a curatorial effort to construct a narrative of ‘situationism’.\nThe case for Merz, Pistoletto and Buren may be different, but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists.\nNowhere in these publications are these connections argued for: they are merely dogmatically asserted.\nGiven the withering contempt expressed by the Situationists for ‘prositus’, one shudders to think what Debord et al .\nare going to make of the ‘quasi-situationists’ discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann.\nOn the basis of her understanding, it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media (and I can think of a good many) is veritably a ‘quasi-situationist’.\nThe desire to create a pseudo-history of the movement's afterlife may be good for business, and may have provided extra material for the book (I refer to the Boston text, see pp. 10–13) but it is not in keeping with the purer aims of the Situationists outlined elsewhere in these and other texts.\nThe second critical comment I came across in the Scrapbook was George Steiner's statement from the Sunday Times in 1967.\nSteiner accepted that the Situationists had identified and accurately described the emptiness of everyday life and even accepts their pleas for subversion, but was very sour about what he described as the ‘depressingly banal’ prescriptions of Debord and the ‘turgid creed’of Vaneigem.\nChristopher Gray, one of the small number of English members of the SI, is the third commentator I found to be not entirely sympathetic.\nHis comments come from an anthology of Situationist writings he edited in 1974.\nGray's comments evoke a kind of mystical disenchantment with the movement  which he found to be too focused on an intellectual critique of society.\n‘There was’, he complains, ‘no concern whatever with either emotions or the body.\nThe SI thought you just had to show how the nightmare worked and everyone would wake up.\nTheir quest was for the perfect formula.'\nThe history of the SI is in some ways a struggle for recognition (despite Debord's evasions) sustained by a radically negative critique which ultimately failed to find a middle way between Hegelian metaphysics and the dynamics of political organisation in the pursuit of its utopian objectives.\nThe declamatory style of writing (which now seems dated) too often obscured the probity of the Situationist's critique of the alienating and manipulative effects of late capitalism and its creation of pseudo-needs.\nThe movement's critique proclaimed a uniqueness and originality for its discoveries to which it was never entitled and which served only to reinforce the self-deluding image of its own power and influence in the world.\nAnti-authoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had of course been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957.\nThe rejection of trade unionism was a common demand amongst anarchists and libertarian socialists.\nAt the end of her life Rosa Luxembourg called for the abolishment of trade unions and promoted the view that workers' councils were essential organisations in the establishment of socialism.\nMore generally the idea of the inseparability of cultural and political revolution has a long history within the libertarian tradition with its roots in revolutionary Romanticism.\nThe more direct inspiration for the Situationists was the Dada-Lettrist connection which provided the aesthetic and political basis for their adoption of non-cognitive methods of expression (such as automatism, chance and other depersonalising techniques of production) and also led to the definition of some key terms in their vocabulary.\nThe critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in Marxist debate in the twentieth century.\nThe Situationists, contribution to this was negligible.\nThe Frankfurt School's Marxian approach to cultural criticism, and production and the social effects of technology and the culture industries pre-dates the writings of Debord, and yet, despite its relative lack of revolutionary fervour remains a far more wide-ranging and thoroughgoing critique of the field.\nThe conjunction of passion and knowledge, of libertarianism and planning, of feeling and thought are conventional oppositions in post-Enlightenment thought which have also bedevilled Marxism.\nThe more orthodox theorists in this tradition have preserved this separation along the lines of a Romanticist/Utilitarian split.\nOthers have sought a reconciliation of the positions that these terms represent, and there is an abundance of literature which examines this relationship in advance of the Situationists.\nIf the Situationist project is flawed, as I believe it is, it is not because antecedent theories of libertarians, Marxists and Council Communists are ignored by them, but rather because they lacked the will to build on this tradition a systematic utopianism consisting of critique and plausible projections into the future.\nLike the Surrealists before them, their transcendence of alienation remains abstractly utopian.\nDespite revolutionary zeal, or perhaps because of it, they sought immediate compensations for the miseries of daily life, and spontaneous methods of attack which they mistook for political strategy.\nThe Situationists' strategy consisted of an exploratory utopianism — a kind of heuristic projection of a future society.\nRaymond Williams has remarked that the danger of the heuristic utopia is that it ‘can settle into isolated and sentimental desire, a means of living with alienation’.\nAnother Surrealist inheritance which distances Situationists from the more radical utopians is their blanket condemnation of work.\n‘Never work!’ announced the Surrealists.\nIt is an amusing quip (especially for those with private means) and makes joyful and nonsensical graffiti.\nBut what does it mean?\nObviously it is an incitement to refusal, and an indictment of alienated labour.\nThe refusal is as understandable as it is naive, but seems to constitute at the same time what amounts to an abnegation of intellectual curiosity about human needs.\nIts political inflexion contests the middle-class work ethic which is the main purpose of its message.\nThe aristocracy, for its part, has never needed to be convinced of the importance of not working.\nFor other theorists such as William Morris, the concept of work is not considered negatively.\nIndeed; for Morris and other Marxists the nature of work necessarily changes in the process of social transformation.\nMarx defined labour as ‘human sensuous activity’.\nLukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice.\nThe plea for an understanding of ‘totality’ in Situationist writing derives from Lukács and Marx whose critique of ‘separation’is directed exactly at the work/leisure distinction.\nAsger Jorn's interest in folk cultures and tribal societies which lacked a notion of ‘art’ as a distinct intellectual practice separated from the common culture, was based on an understanding of the extent to which the spheres of art and work have become conflicting practices within bourgeois relations of production.\nDespite this the common tendency in SI writing on most forms of directed or purposeful activity (other than agitation or ‘destructive creativity') is negative.\nThe aristocratic disdain for manual labour has its counterpart in the Situationist’ attitude to the working class considered as the moronised victims of the spectacle.\nIn contrast the Situationists' notion of pleasure is a negation of work in almost every sense of the word — a kind of involuntary idleness in the land of Cockaigne.\nTheir notion of pleasure is indistinguishable from a sixties Zeitgeist.\nIts meaning is inadequately theorised and remains largely at the  level of common sense, a crude alternative to the repressive order of work.\nNow that Situationist texts are widely available (and with these publications adding to the list) it is ironic that they seem less crucial than they once did.\nTheir appeal in the past was partly attributable to the popular texture of some aspects of the writing, its accessibility and its festive and irreverent politics.\nThese writings appealed essentially to a generation of students bored with academic life and attracted by the street credibility of the Situationists, and often provided students with the dubious pleasure of being flattered and insulted at the same time.\nThe Situationist lifestyle (in so far as it could be imagined) had some influence on the hippy sub-culture in the late sixties and punk ideology in the seventies in Britain.\nSituationist influence was more menacingly felt in France especially in the universities, although it has to be said that their influence upon the events of May 1968 has been exaggerated.\nFor the most part, however, the legacy of the movement remained less obviously political, and restricted in its appeal to fairly specific audiences in the cultural milieu and especially the visual arts.\nIndeed, the extent to which the Situationist influence has flourished in the spheres of art and popular culture is noteworthy and contrasts with the absence of the movement's influence in other domains.\nThe uneven profile of the Situationist group and its existential fragmentation together with the eclectic and impromptu formal character of the artefacts they produced, as I have suggested above, make it an ideal type for the postmodernist critic.\nThe Situationists' rejection of the classical model of left-wing monumentalism, and their apparent lack of commitment to the historical overview or the grand narrative is consistent with postmodernism.\nMoreover, the freedom with which they juxtapose theory and humour, and plagiarise for artistic effect suggests strong affinity with the postmodern.\nThe decline of the meta-narrative in favour of aphoristic models of philosophical expression (following Feuerbach and Nietzche) has been the favoured form of the Situationists.\nThe fact that Baudrillard's name has been linked with the Situationists should not be held against them.\nNevertheless, the de-Marxisation of their project by him and the ‘death of the social’ which he has announced should alert us to the doubts raised by Raymond Williams on the issue of certain types of Utopianism.\nThe concept of the spectacle is an effective term which now has a wide currency, but perhaps only in a sense which approximates its use by the Situationists.\nThe historical period which has seen its political devaluation is one in which political optimism has become unfashionable, which perhaps is one way of explaining the retrospective or merely historicist character of the Situationist exhibition, and the books I have reviewed.\nWe have seen a shift from the utopianism of the 1960s to a culture of nostalgia and, as with the more dystopian elements in postmodernism, the exhibition and the books which accompany it look backward in a search for appearances as if they were compensatory fantasies substituting for a forgotten dream."

') or a new ‘reading’?\nThe recourse to books, documents, or sources, underscores a perception which is somehow already in the air.\nThe effort to recapture art's ‘history’ is always entangled with the desire to remake its identity and meaning as part of contemporary struggles.\nThis article comes out of the familiar experience of being drawn to a particular image, or set of images, without at first knowing why, and the attempt to account for this feeling.\nLooking intermittently at the so-called colonial art of Latin America in churches, museums, private collections and books, I became magnetised by the figures of angels.\nThey are extraordinarily resplendent.\nThey have a material splendour in their dress.\nThe spiritual (or is it the psychic?) intensity of their presence goes together with a marvellous air of freedom and delicacy.\nThey have a tendency to expand, to fill the picture space.\nIf the angel is already a hybrid (a human with wings), the Latin American angels seem to incorporate further incongruities into this composite of the human and the supernatural which hints at further, latent meanings.\nI knew that these paintings were produced for the Spanish in the decades after their conquest of Latin America, and represented the christianising of the old centres of Inca culture, in Peru and Bolivia especially.\nI knew that in the main they were painted by Indian and mestizo artists at the command of the Europeans.\nIt lodged in my mind to try and answer the question as to whether there was something special about the depiction of angels in post-conquest art, and if so, what it could be.\nI didn't make a systematic study but I occasionally followed up clues if I came across references in books and catalogues.\nI soon learned that the theme of angels was one of the most popular in the paintings produced by indigenous artists for the complex iconographic programmes of the churches and missions established by the Spanish after the conquest.\nThis word ‘popular’ is of course problematic and will be returned to a little later.\nAll colonial painting began in a process of copying.\nIndian artists were obliged, or forced, to abandon their own forms of representation and learn the European way.\nBut after a period of sheer copying, some themes took off.\nSome developed differently in the American context.\nWhy did angels especially flourish?\nAs I investigated further, it seemed to become clear that if this question could be answered it could only be in a complex way.\nThese paintings, in other words, could only be read as the site of a complex play of forces.\nThey were not simply transcriptions of the power of the conquerors and the coercive force with which they attempted to annihilate the existing culture and beliefs of the Indians and impose Christianity.\nNor, obviously, were they a simple expression of Indian resistance to this assault.\nIn some way they were both these things at once.\nThe more I looked into it the more the paintings seemed to go beyond simple unitary ideas of authorship and meaning.\nThe Peruvian art historian Luis Enrique Tord has written:\nThe Spanish conquest of the Inca empire had a profound impact on many aspects of Indian society, but by far the most serious blows suffered by the Andean peoples were administered by the Church.\nThe efforts of priests and missionaries to eradicate the Indians' ancestral beliefs produced profound emotional disturbances as well as great changes in their conception of the world.\nTo enforce conformity to the new orthodoxy, the Spaniards instituted ecclesiastical visitas , or inspections intended to extirpate the idolatory that persisted long after the conquest.\nIn the sphere of art the range of subjects and genres permitted by the church was extremely narrow, only in fact religious paintings and portraits.\nAt that time after the conquest there was effectively no ‘thought’(recorded discourse) outside the religious framework and institutions.\nThe first university in Peru, for example, was founded by the Dominicans.\nPainting was from the beginning one of the most important instruments of conquest in the sphere of thinking, the mind.\nIn the earliest years of their missionary efforts Dr Tord writes:\nthe friars discovered that the Indians were deeply impressed by sacred images created with the newest artistic techniques brought from the Old World…\nThose images were first seen in the catechisms, Bibles, books of hours, and hymnals used to convert the Indians and direct their worship.\n‘The Archangel Raphael’, by a follower of Luis de Riano, Cuzco School c. 1640.\nOil on canvas, 65″ x 42″.\nConvento de San Francisco, La Paz.\nThe Jesuits brought over their leading painter in Europe in the late sixteenth century, the Italian Bernardo Bitti, to live and work in Cuzco.\nA school of painting grew up in Cuzco which became the leading centre of the production of paintings south of Mexico and exported paintings and painters to many other parts of the continent including remote areas.\nLeopoldo Castedo, the Spanish-Chilean art historian writes:\nOf forty-seven painters documented in Cuzco during the period, thirty-five were Indians, seven criollos or mestizos, four Spaniards, and one Italian.\nThis list does not include the great number of Indians who remained anonymous….\nThe similes usually used to describe the stylistic hybrid produced over the years by the Cuzco painters — the ‘melding’, or ‘blending’, or the ‘intricate amalgamation’ of European and indigenous traditions to produce an art of ‘Byzantine richness and splendour’— obviously belies the violence of events.\nThese phrases do, however, have the ring of truth in an aesthetic sense — or rather there was an aesthetic process involved which had to some extent its own story.\nThis was manifested not only in the precise, artistic and critical response by Indian peoples to European paintings, but also in connoisseurship within the colonising ranks.\nA blossoming of the arts followed the rebuilding of Cuzco after the catastrophic earthquake of 1650, partly due to the arrival of Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo.\nHis collection included two El Grecos, and other outstanding Spanish pictures, and he sponsored Indian painters like Diego Quispe Tito, as well as sculptors, architects and jewellers.\nSometimes the coercion and oppression is felt directly in the paintings: for example, in images of Saint Isidore, a rather obscure Spanish saint vastly amplified in the New World as the patron of labourers, who is shown to carry a small bag of coca leaves as the Indian peasants and miners did, and do, to chew to combat hunger and fatigue.\nCastedo points this out.\nHe also shows that images of Santiago (St James) staying the moors were often changed to Santiago slaying the Indians .\nIndian painters would in this case be painting an image showing the Church's and the State's warning to Indians who contemplated rebellion, as many did.\nAnd occasionally, as, for example, during or around the time of the rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II in 1780, an image would appear of explicit resistance to colonialism.\nIn the somewhat unlikely context of the Pelican History of Art (the relevant volume is Art and Architecture in Spain and Portugal and their American Dominions 1500–1800 ), an anonymous painting is described which shows America:\nnursing Spanish noble boys.\nNegroes and mestizos are pressing around her throne, while nude Indian children weep abandoned.\nTwo richly dressed Indian couples present their gifts in a beautiful park crowded with different animals.\nThe legend says: Where in the world has one seen what one sees here…\nHer own sons lie groaning and she suckles strangers.\nThe images of angels are much more ambiguous and capable of different interpretations (this could, of course, be said of the angel theme generally as it recurs in the history of art, and in various guises across different cultures).\nIt is not hard to find documentary evidence for the Church's deliberate use of the angel theme as an instrument of conversion.\nThe Bolivian art historian Teresa Gisbert writes that the Councils of Lima, which were responsible for questions of orthodoxy in the Viceroyalty: ‘sought to attract Indians to the new faith by the use of images which would be especially appealing to them.'\nWhy were angels appealing to them?\nIn the Pelican History, Martin Soria tentatively puts forward the theory that angels were popular because ‘they replaced similar messengers in pre-conquest beliefs’.\nTeresa Gisbert produces evidence to show that Diego Quispe Tito's series of paintings of the zodiac for the Cathedral of Cuzco was commissioned in order to counteract the traditional indigenous worship of the stars and were intended to aid in Christianising the Indians of the Andes.\nAnd she suggests that the angels, especially the series of angels, could have a similar purpose, to ‘replace worship of celestial phenomena with the theologically acceptable cult of the angels’.\nSo apparently they were ‘popular’, for different reasons, with both Christian and native American, with oppressor and oppressed.\nIt is as if you could read in them simultaneously transcriptions of inducement, threat, coercion, protection, solace, yearning and resistance.\nDoes this explain their complex expressivity?\nFor the same quality can be interpreted differently according to one's point of view, one's experience, and one's feelings.\nProtection can mean Defence of the Faith, i.e. of Christianity, or it can mean the adoption and identification of a ‘guardian spirit’, who will watch over your life-journey, a universal, but at the same time very individual and personal desire, expressed in most religions and cultures.\nLooking at the angel's image you can dream, ask for what you want.\nThe angel, with its brilliantly opulent but light clothing, its mobility, its freedom from hierarchical placing in the pictorial composition, and its bisexuality, is an intimate image of enablement.\nAmong the images of angels is a genre apparently unique to South America, even to the Andes, the Angels with Guns.\nThis was also a very popular subject (one church inventory for 1748, for example, lists 36 pictures of armed angels).\nJulia P. Herzberg, who calls these pictures ‘representations of winged  beings at once military, aristocratic and religious, gives this explanation of their raison d'être:\nPaintings of angels with guns appeared at a time when the religious orders were confronted with the stubborn persistence of pre-conquest religion amongst their Indian charges.\nImmense problems remained not merely in the campaign to destroy Indian idols, but in teaching and reinforcing the principles of the new faith.\nSermons and catechisms were of course the primary means of conversion, but images of angels with guns were useful symbols of important teachings of the church.\nThe Spaniards conquered the Incas with both the Cross and the arquebus.\nThe key to understanding the religious function of these images is found in the gun motif.\nFirearms, unknown to the Indians at the time of the conquest, seemed a frightening manifestation of the supernatural, for they ‘fled out of fear when there was a blare of trumpets, the roar of arquebuses and artillery’.\nThe firearm in an angel's hands must have had a powerful impact on Indian converts.\nBut since guns were also used defensively, the images functioned symbolically as reminders of the protection offered to those who embraced Christianity.\nThe image of the angel with a gun served a secular as well as a religious function by emphasising the lesson that the Church and the Spanish colonial régime were united in their goal to christianize the Indians.\nThe military aspect of the crusade is subliminally suggested by the gentle figure who handles his firing weapon in varied positions which recall those of a fighting force.\nIn speaking about the angels' clothing, Herzberg continues:\nFar more important than the military aspects of the angel's costumes are the explicit references to the high social status of both Spanish colonial gentlemen and Inca royalty.\nRichly brocaded fabrics, ribbons, and lace characterize the opulent viceregal dress of the 17th century.\nThe gentlemen-aristocratic nature of angels with guns is defined by their elegant dress, which relates them directly to the ruling viceregal aristocracy.\nA key phrase here seems to me to be ‘gentle figure who handles his firing weapon’.\nAlthough the technical military details of loading and handling the gun and so on, of the angel paintings, is very precise — taken in fact from a Flemish military manual of 1607 — the ‘common soldier’ of the image in the manual is not retained: he becomes the gorgeous aristocrat.\nThe non-aggressive angel-like  pose, is of course extremely seductive, which makes the threat of force oblique, only implied, as if a beautiful face was being laid over the ugly face of violent coercion.\nAre these pictures simply transcriptions of power, in which the hard approach is mixed with the soft, and the Church is allied with the State (and in this case hinting as well, not just at the foreigner's domination of the native inhabitants but also at class conflict within colonial society, since the angel is a mélange of Spanish and Inca aristocracies)?\nPerhaps.\nBut again they seem to me more enigmatic, more multiple — images full of aesthetic tensions.\nCan one again make a conflation between domination and rebellion in the image, an expression of both the Church/State and the Indian wishes?\nLeopoldo Castedo writes:\nThe prestige of the armed archangel was and is still very great.\nIn mestizo architectural decoration of the 18th century, the archangel brandishing the flaming sword had a prominent place (particularly fine examples are in the Cathedral of Puno and San Lorenzo, in Potosi); and in the traditional diablada boliviana (Bolivian devil play), a religious drama, the Archangel Michael defeats […]the Devil of the Seven Masks.\nIn 1950, in a curious or consistent coincidence (as Castedo Pointedly calls it $, Pope Pius XII declared the Archangel Michael patron of police — a decision that may well diminish the archangel's prestige in Latin America.\n‘Archangel with Gun’, by an anonymous painter of the Cuzco School, early 18th century.\nOil on canvas, 63 1/4″ x 39 1/2″.\nMuseo de Arte, Lima.\n‘Archangel with Gun’, by the Master of Calamarca (José Lopez du los Rios?)\nLake Titicaca School, c. 1684.\nOil on canvas, 63 5/8″ x 46 1/2″.\nMuseo Nacional de Arte, La Paz.\nAside from dealing, as I have been doing, with one of the major subjects and themes of Cuzco painting, an inventory could be made of ways in which painters departed from European models, or from academic notions of excellence.\nThere are peripheral insertions, like borders of flowers, or tropical birds which populate the background landscapes of many religious paintings.\nOr survivals at the level of colour: liking for flat and intense colours, local earth and vegetable dyes, which may go all the way back to the ancient textile traditions such as that of the Paracas culture in Peru.\nAlso, intensification of the colours in the angels' wings as compared with Europe.\nThese questions were not merely ‘academic’.\nDisputes among Spanish and Indian painters themselves, in some ways antecedents of all subsequent debates around ‘indigenism’, go back to the early days in Cuzco.\nIn 1688 the Cuzco guild of painters split.\nThe immediate reason seems to have been that Indian painters working for some of the Spanish and criollo masters complained of mistreatment.\nThe Spanish admitted their guilt but no agreement could be reached and the two sides moved apart.\nThe Spanish guild tightened its European rules of style.\nThe Indian painters lost contact with European developments and, according to Teresa Gisbert, ‘sought inspiration both in the old styles and in their own tastes and traditions’, a mixture of ornamental stylisation with observation of the reality around them.\nTheir religious pictures, she writes, ‘belong to an archaic world […$ who viewed the religious realm as something ‘different’ from mundane reality.'\nThe argument so far has been intended to put forward the possibility that an art work or image could be official and coercive, and unofficial and subversive, all at the same time.\nThe example I have given is by no means the only one that exists.\nThe  same process has been documented in other situations where a people have been conquered, colonised and their cultural beliefs assaulted.\nEduardo Mondlane found that African carvers in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Mozambique had made their own use of Christian themes imposed by priests and missionaries:\nWhen a [makonde]sculptor departs from the stereotype […$ this is nearly always because an element of doubt or defiance has been worked into it; a madonna is given a demon to hold instead of the Christ Child; a priest is represented with the feet of a wild animal, a pietà becomes a study not of sorrow but of revenge, with the mother raising a spear over the body of her dead son.\nMagazine advertisement, featuring a painting by Botero.\nSuch images may startlingly demonstrate the general truth that the meaning of a work cannot simply be equated with its subject.\nBut particularly intriguing is the phenomenon of syncretisation itself, as an artistic process, and its relationship to meaning: the process whereby something new is created that cannot simply be reduced to either side of two antagonistic forces, or returned to a former ‘purity’.\nA new ‘in-between’ is created.\nThis is especially true in the context of Latin America where this kind of duality and fusion has been a feature of culture from the time of the conquest right up until today — both on the popular and the intellectual level.\n‘Latin America is such a syncretic, eccentric, disjointed fusion of European, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean culture,’ in the words of the Mexican artist Guillermo Gomez-Peña.\nOr, as the Chilean painter Juan Davila recently put it: ‘You take something of yourself, something of the conqueror’.\nIn both cases these are intellectuals talking about their own work by linking it with a process continually taking place at a popular level and in everyday life.\nToday, the image of the angel is still alive, and still in contention; it has by no means been merely consigned to the museum.\nIt is still a part of contemporary power struggles.\nOn the one hand it has appeared as a focus for resistance.\nThe militant angel appeared, for example, in wall paintings in Haiti during the shortlived popular uprising for food and democracy of 1986.\nThe extraordinarily effective popular figure of the masked Superbarrio, who emerged spontaneously to lead the movement to demand the provision of proper housing in the aftermath of the disastrous Mexican earthquake of 1986, surely appeals to memories of the angel-enabler, along with references to Mexican popular masked wrestling heroes and perhaps to Superman.\nAt the same time, the armed angel is continually reproduced as a figure of folklore, a naive stereotype of Latin America, typically exploited in the paintings of Fernando Botero, the highest selling Latin American artist in the world today.\nHis shallow humour trades in, but misses the actual drama and sensibility of that hybrid fusion of the aristocratic and the popular which took place all those years ago in Cuzco.\nSymbolic angel lances a Tonton Macoute on a mural in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 1989.\nPhoto by Pablo Butcher.\nAn Inca Warrior in the guise of the Archangel Michael with a flaming sword.\nStone carving in a church at Potosi, Bolivia, 18th century.\n‘Popular culture is not what is technically called folklore, but the popular language of permanent historical rebellion.’\nThis sentence, by the Brazilian film-maker Glauber Rocha, written at the turn of the 1970s, clearly identifies a form of expression with a mass of oppressed people whose experience has been continuous over at least four centuries.\nAnd Glauber also implies that the forms and images in which this experience is expressed are not fixed but open and changing.\nThe sentence comes from an essay called Eztetyke du Rêve , an eccentric spelling of Esthétique du Rêve (‘Aesthetic of the Dream') in which, building on the idea that ‘the dream is the only right which cannot be forbidden’, Glauber Rocha described how he had come to realise the revolutionary importance of the mystical in Latin American popular culture.\nIt was the only way of contesting that ‘bourgeois reason’ which, for him, was as much a feature of left-wing political programmes as it was of traditional colonial domination.\nIn his 1965 article, ‘Aesthetic of Hunger’, enormously influential on Third World cinema and art, Glauber felt he had given ‘the measure of my rational understanding of poverty’.\nBy 1971 he was saying that, as artists:\nWe must touch, by communion, the vital point of poverty which is its mysticism.\nThis mysticism is the only language which transcends the rational schema of oppression.\nThe role of the angel as an intermediary between the human and the mystical world, and its elaborate beautifying as a vehicle of the dream, would seem to tie in closely with Glauber's identification of a continuing thread of psychological resistance in Latin American culture.\nThe writer would like to express his appreciation of the art historical studies of Teresa Gisbert, Leopoldo Castedo, Julia P. Herzberg and dr Luis Enrique Tord, to which he has been deeply indebted in writing this article .\n‘HER DRESS HANGS HERE': DE-FROCKING THE KAHLO CULT\nOriana Baddeley\nThe 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishment's attitudes towards art produced outside of its traditional parameters.\nThe work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced out of the ‘modern masters’ market.\nAlmost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain — graffiti art, Soviet art, Australian art, the art of Latin America.\nThe major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago.\nThe current status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic example of this change.\nOnce known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera, her reputation outside of Mexico now far supercedes his: since 1919, sale room estimates of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million, and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke all records at Sotheby's New York for a Latin American artist.\nThe enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content.\nWhile the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, it was the publication of Hayden Herrera's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status.\nSince that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries, a feature film (‘Frida’ by Paul Leduc), a stage play, numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing.\nIn May 1989 Elle magazine ran a 16 page feature on Frida Kahlo as the ‘spirit of Mexico’(Fig. 1), while in Vogue (Feb. 1990) there was a 10 page interpretation of ‘the romance of Frida Kahlo's Mexico’(Fig. 2).\nAlmost as a logical outcome of this media blitz, it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna, already a devotee of Kahlo's work, was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo's life.\nFig. 1.\nElle Magazine , May 1989, p. 18–19.\nAs with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination, such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of Kahlo's admittedly fascinating life.\nThe passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera, her flamboyant appearance, but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work.\nWhile Kahlo's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life, for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art.\nIn this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of Van Gogh, a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death.\nThe archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990's long hot summer.\nYet despite the iconic status of Van Gogh's ‘tragic’ life, it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified, his thick impasto brush-stroke, his vibrant yellows, the urgency of his creative drive.\nIn the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself, the characteristic brows, the elaborate hair, the Mexican costume (Fig. 3).\nIt is primarily her appearance, not the formal language of her art, that has graced the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines.\nThe Elle feature transposed the ‘Kahlo style’ to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herrera's biography of  the artist.\nIn the later Vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual, Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their ‘Mexican’ interiors.\nThere is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4).\nThe visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work.\nIn both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself; exotic, passionate, yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit.\nWhile Elle, Vogue and subsequently The Independent (Fig. 5), stressed different facets of Kahlo's public persona, they all shared the emphasis on ‘her’, as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of Mexico, rather than her work.\nIt is her body as the canvas, her appearance as art.\nThe art of self-expression becomes self-expression as art.\nFig. 2.\nVogue , February 1990, p. 130–1.\nFig. 3.\nElle Magazine , May 1989, p. 28.\nOf course, the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlo's case.\nThe majority of her work is self portraiture; her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance.\nDressing up, role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlo's work.\nIn Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair (1944)(Fig. 6), she paints herself wearing Rivera's suit, challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority (while simultaneously) threatening castration).\nMore disturbingly, in The Mask (1945)(Fig. 7), she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions.\nWhere does the mask fall: Does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features ‘mask’ far more than it uncovers?\nThere is, however, an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image, a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933: ‘…some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‘a la Mexicana’, but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible.'\nThe ‘impossibility’ stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo's choice of clothing, a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances.\nThe particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic, by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde.\nFor Kahlo, however, choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana, as for example in Tree of Hope (1946)(Fig. 8), was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity.\nMexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific, varying from region to  region.\nThe Tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-Hispanic forms of clothing.\nIt is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlo's choice.\nThe ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led to the adoption of the Tehuana, in post-revolutionary Mexico, as the image of the strong Indian woman; the undefeated counterpart to the despised ‘Chingada’, who, conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico's hybrid post-conquest culture.\nIn a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict, the Tehuana represents that aspect of Mexico's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule.\nKahlo's adoption of Tehuana dress, while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body, asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position.\nFig. 4.\nVogue , February 1990, p. 138.\nFig. 5.\nThe Independent on Sunday , 8th April 1990, p. 37.\nIn Kahlo's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses, yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work.\nIt is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved.\nHer work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman's art.\nThe fascination with functions of the body, the analogies between artistic  and physical creative processes, self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s.\nFig. 6 .\nFrida Kahlo:Self-portrait with cropped hair , 1940, 40x27.9 cm.\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York.\nFig. 7.\nFrida Kahlo: The Mask , 1945, 40x30.5 cm.\nColl.\nDolores Olmeda.\nFig. 8 .\nFrida Kahlo:The Tree of Hope , 1946, 55.9x40.6 cm.\nColl.\nIsidore Ducasse Fine Arts Inc.\nIn their formal language, Kahlo's works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments; the adoption of the decorative, the intimate and non-fine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of ‘high art’.\nThis ‘appropriateness’ of Kahlo's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context, to stress the collective and the cross-cultural.\nAlthough this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic, it has diminished the complexity of Kahlo's achievement as a specifically Mexican painter, operating within the particularities of her historical moment.\nMore problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her ‘Mexicanness’ as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work, thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by Breton as a ‘ribbon round a bomb’.\nIt is the ribbon that runs through the pages of Vogue , the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work such as Kahlo's The Suicide of Dorothy Hale (1939)(Fig. 9).\nIn this painting, a memorial to a woman's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her.\nHale's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of New York and North America in general.\nThe story behind Hale's death was one with which Kahlo obviously identified, and within which dress formed an important symbolic function.\nBefore jumping from the window of her apartment, Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress, the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer.\nIn Kahlo's painting, the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street, literally coming down to earth.\nHale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer, a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture.\nThe horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building.\nShe leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world.\nAlthough destroyed, she has also escaped.\nThe painting, dedicated to Hale's mother, was commissioned by a mutual friend of Kahlo and Dorothy Hale, the managing editor of Vanity Fair , Clare Boothe Luce.\nThe painting was agreed to by Luce in part to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend.\nHaving lent Hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an haute-couture dress, and refused to turn up to what, in retrospect, became Hale's farewell party.\nLater it was revealed that the money had come from a different source.\nA male friend had tried to dissuade Hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy ‘the most beautiful dress in New York’, telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband.\nOn one level this work deals with a generalised ‘woman's experience’, yet the metaphorical power of Dorothy Hale's dress derives from Kahlo's use of clothing in her own self-portraits.\nDress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses.\nHale's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the ‘Gringolandia’ so hated by Kahlo.\nIn those paintings where Kahlo wears European dress she is passive, weak and unable to control her own destiny, but in the Tehuana costume she is strong, powerful, hopeful.\nUnclothed, her body becomes yet more vulnerable, but as Jean Franco states:\nThe unclothed body is not a ‘self but a socialised body, a body that is opened by instruments, technologized, wounded, its organs displayed to the outside world.\nThe ‘inner’ Frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed Frida, who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer.\nKahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of Mexico's colonised past: La Llorona ‘the weeping woman’ of popular myth and La Chingada, the raped and abused mother described in Paz's The Labyrinth of Solitude .\nDescended from an Aztec mother goddess, Llorona is a long-suffering mother figure, symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the  Spanish invasion.\nDriven mad with grief by the loss of her child, she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the pre-Conquest past.\nAt its most simple, La Chingada, as the mother of Mestizo culture is ‘the Mother forcibly opened, violated or deceived’.\nThe female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the Spanish invaders.\nThe Indian Mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child.\nThe rhetoric of the Tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma, and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance.\nFig 9 .\nFrida Kahlo:The Suicide of Dorothy Hale , 1939, 58.1x47.5 cm.\nPhoenix Art Museum, Arizona.\nA major, though often ignored, work by Kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art.\nMy Dress Hangs There (1939)(Fig. 10) is one of the artist’ s most formally adventurous works, mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of North American culture.\nKahlo does not appear in the work, her Tehuana costume hangs empty in the centre of the composition, suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy.\nOn one level My Dress…is a coda to Self-Portrait on the Borderline (1932)(Fig. 11) of the previous year.\nThis small painting on metal, in the style of a Catholic votive image, shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist North America and the archaic fertility of Mexico.\nInterwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America.\nThis is done by a series of juxtapositions; the past versus the present; female nature versus masculine technology; growth versus exploitation; and in its very material presence, the traditions of fine art versus the popular.\nAt the same time the ambivalence of her own, and modern Mexico's position is manifested in the figure of the artist.\nThe paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand.\nThe red and green of the Aztec necklace links it compositionally with the indigenous plants to the ‘south’ of the painting, the pink colonial-style dress tonally blending with the skyscrapers to the ‘north’.\nMy Dress …again suggests a conflict, but the ambivalence is gone.\nNature has been banished, technology and its concomitant values reign over a harshly masculine world.\nThree elements refer to the female presence, all of them dealing with an essential lack.\nThe empty dress, a peeling poster of Mae West and in the far distance the Statue of Liberty.\nFig. 10 .\nFrida Kahlo:My Dress Hangs There , 1933, 46x50 cm, estate of dr.\nLeo Eloesser.\nAlthough occasionally humorous, the work presents a bleak view of urban alienation.\nThe Church, Wall Street, and Industry are joined by a network of telephone lines, forming a remorsely inhuman environment.\nBeneath this man-made mechanism of oppression are the people, literally distanced from their surroundings by Kahlo's use of photo-collage.\nIn the forefront of this scene flutters the dress, incongruously vibrant despite its suggestion of loss.\nDislocated from its political context, it hangs like a piñata above the teeming streets of the city; decorative yet potentially explosive.\nThere is no place ‘there’ for the values the Tehuana dress represents, its folds are given meaning by Kahlo's search for a cultural identity.\nWithin the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest, a reminder of political alternatives.\nThe physicality so characteristic of Kahlo's work is missing, no flesh, no blood, just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost Liberty.\nThe inter-relationship of body and dress so self-consciously referred to in many of Kahlo's most polemical works (Fig. 12) has been strangely inverted by her current popularity.\nHer ‘Mexicanness’ has become a stylistic gloss, decorative, colourful, pretty, even individualistic.\nThe colonised body which Kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering.\nWhat is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing, in both art and life, that Kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history.\nFig. 11

D.F.\nSURREALISING THE BAROQUE: MEXICO'S SPANISH HERITAGE AND THE WORK OF ALBERTO GIRONELLA\nValerie Fraser\nIt is a truism to say that that which cannot be readily classified will tend to be overlooked.\nIn Art History the rehabilitation of artists and bodies of work which have been overlooked has been going on since Vasari made such a good job of classifying Florentine art that all other art in Italy and beyond has had to be defined, at least until this century, and at some level even now, in relation to Vasari's classifications, or at least in relation to the model of stylistic evolution which he outlined.\nNon-Italian artists, non-Italian preoccupations, women artists, artists working in media other than Vasari's chosen painting, sculpture and architecture, non-Western art and so on: critics have been busy reviewing such areas and, in so doing, producing new categories and classifications.\nLatin American art has been undergoing such a review both from within Latin America itself and from elsewhere, with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in Europe and the US.\nThat there should be an issue of the Oxford Art Journal devoted to Latin American art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts.\nBut new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive.\nWithin the field of Latin American art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern.\nIn the case of the work of the Mexican Alberto Gironella, the reason would seem to be precisely because of his insistent concentration on art of a very different category — that of Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly court portraiture.\nAmong the more comprehensive books on twentieth-century Mexican art in recent years, Shifra Goldman only mentions him in passing, Luis Cardoza y Aragón says little more than that Gironella ‘escapes him’, and Ida Rodriguez Prampolini dismisses him from her discussion of Mexican surrealism as an ‘international’ artist, more closely related to Spain than to Mexico.\nWhen he has inspired sympathetic coverage, the results tend to be not so much an exposition of Gironella's achievements but belong to that particular branch of literature which uses works of art as a starting point for literary excursus.\nOctavio Paz's elegant essay is the prime example, where despite some insightful remarks he uses Gironella's work to make general observations about the creative role of the critic, for example, or for digressive flourishes on Spanish culture.\nWhen they met in Paris in 1963, Breton hailed him as a surrealist, but in a recent interview Gironella disclaimed so tidy a classification, saying he is as much a baroque artist as a surrealist.\nIn fact, although there are both surreal and baroque elements in his work, Gironella prefers to call it mestizo’, a term which has often had negative, racist overtones but which has been acclaimed in this century, especially in Mexico, as a positive value, indeed the distinguishing feature of Mexican culture: the rich and fruitful mixture of the European with the indigenous American.\nThis rather simple notion, that there is one single Mexican culture, problematic principally because it tends to valorize the European over the indigenous and to ignore the diversity, and richness of the latter, but also, conversely, because it excludes or denigrates the more purely European aspects of the culture.\nNevertheless it seems to me that Gironella is right, or that he is right in so far as he is using ‘mestizo’ to claim for his work a Mexican, not a European identity.\nHe is probably also right when he says that he is only seen as a Spanish artist because his interest lies in Spanish art, instead of in French art ‘like everyone else': in other words, within the accepted categories there is no room for a Mexican who is interested in Spanish art.'\nMy purpose in what follows is to try to place him within a Mexican context.\nGironella's subject matter is the acclaimed artistic masterpieces of the Spanish past which he reworks in various ways, most dramatically into ironic altars assembled from a variety of painted, sculpted and ready-made elements (Fig. 1).\nFavoured subjects are court portraiture, and allegorical images of death, decay and the transience of life, usually handled with the blackest of black humour.\nFavoured artists are Goya and his predecessors in the Golden Age —— El Greco, Pereda, Valdés Leal and above all Velázquez.\nIt is worth emphasising that the period spanned by the lives of El Greco and Velázquez saw in Latin America the consolidation of colonial government and of the Christian church, the establishment of the Spanish language and of European culture, the introduction of new methods of exploitation of people and resources.\nGoya's life, on the other hand, coincides with the decline and ultimate collapse of the Empire; Spanish rule in America had been overthrown by the time of his death in 1828.\nIn other words, these artists lived during Latin American's formative years.\nthe work of the artists who interpreted their historical reality on to canvas, but the importance in Latin America of the art itself should not be underestimated, particularly the iconography of the monarchy.\nVelázquez's name, for example, would have been familiar to very few Mexicans in the seventeenth century, but as the only artist authorised to execute likenesses of the King his official portraits of Philip IV and the innumerable engravings after them would have been well known.\nA painting by his contemporary, Juan Bautista Maino,The Recapture of Bahia , of 1635, represents the recapture of the harbour of Bahia in Brazil (then under Spanish control) from the Dutch in 1625.\n(Fig. 2) While an injured man is tended in the foreground, the Dutch forces to the right kneel in homage before an allegorical tapestried portrait of Philip IV.\nThis is a highly unusual painting in a number of ways, not least because no such royal portrait could ever have existed, including as it does, and on almost equal status with the king, the figure of his ambitious minister the Count-Duke of Olivares.\nNevertheless, on special occasions the Spanish authorities in America would certainly have erected large representations of the king in this manner, as objects of semi-religious devotion.\nOn the death of a member of the royal family elaborate catafalques were constructed in cathedrals throughout the Empire and the deceased mourned in effigy.\nPaintings and prints were distributed to colonial officials for display in much the same way as British embassies are provided with an official photographic portrait of the Queen.\nIn other words, the focus of Gironella's attention is neither historically nor iconographically arbitrary, although in some ways his reworkings of the paintings of others could be seen to be simply an extension of a fairly conventional activity.\nWithin the Western tradition of art we tend to take it for granted that much can be learned from the study of the art of the past and, traditionally, copying from the works of the Great Masters was one of a young student's most important tasks.\nThis activity, this dependence on the art of the past, is not, in itself, ideologically highly-charged.\nReynolds may have admired and borrowed from Michelangelo, and while this could be said to represent, perhaps, a long-standing tradition of cultural domination — or the domination in England of the Italianate tastes of the English upper classes — it would be a mistake to make too much of this.\nIn the case of Latin America it is more complex.\nHistorically the relationship between Latin America and Europe is not only one of cultural domination of the former by the latter, but of political and economic domination.\nWhile the obvious colonial ties have been broken, the power still lies elsewhere.\nThe sources of domination have in some ways simply broadened to include the US, japan, and international capitalism.\nWithin the art world the problem remains that the production of art in Latin America, from a student's training to the art market, is rooted firmly in the European tradition, while to compound the difficulties, few Latin American museums can boast any examples of European, North American or even non-national art at all.\nEverything conspires to exacerbate the situation: conventional art education teaches an art-historical line of descent through the successive achievements of the Great Masters, but such works are unavailable in Latin America except in the form of often poor-quality reproductions.\nIn this sense things have not changed much since the seventeenth century.\nGironella always seems acutely aware of these issues.\nFor him the reworking of familiar images is not simply a matter of drawing attention to the way in which mass-reproduction numbs the optic nerves, by shocking the spectator with a moustached Mona Lisa, but rather, using a peculiar blend of both iconoclasm and a sort of wry homage, of investigating the power of certain images, particularly those which have national resonance.\nIn this sense his Habsburg and Bourbon portraits are not dissimilar to Jasper Johns' American flag series, except of course that the flag, whatever individuals may think of it, is unquestionably American, the lineage is clear.\nThe connecting threads between the Spanish  monarchy and colonial Mexico, between Spanish artists and Mexican, between past and present, are tangled or broken.\nWithin Spanish art itself, on the other hand, the line is almost too simple: Goya was intensely aware of Velázquez, Picasso of both, but for Gironella the problem is not just that Picasso could be seen to have inserted himself into the next place in the sequence but that as a Mexican an unequivocal position in any such art-historical lineage is utterly unattainable.\nFig. 1 .\nAlberto Gironella,Lot y sus hijas (Lot and his Daughters), 1984-1987; retable, 303 x 241.5 x 30 cms, collection of the artist.\nPhotograph: Jorge Pablo de Aguinaco, courtesy Galeria OMR, Mexico.\nGironella was born in Mexico City in 1929.\nHis rather was Catalan; he had come to Mexico as a young man and worked in his brother-in-law's grocery shop.\nHe later set up his own business importing groceries from Europe, particularly from Spain.\nHis mother was Yucatecan, a mestiza from Mérida, but she was ‘catalanised’, as Gironella put it, by his father and grandmother; in other words a jointly Eurocentric upbringing, but, perhaps significantly, without personal contact with Europe until his first visit to Paris in 1960.\nHe absorbed European culture through nineteenth-century French novels, and through the literature of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain, the Spanish cultural Golden Age.\nHis major literary enterprise, as a student at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma in 1951, was the invention of a bad Golden Age poet whom he named Tiburcio Esquirla.\nHis later artistic inventions display the same fascination with the possibilities of getting inside the skin of another era.\nThrough his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars, historians, literary critics and art historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can ‘belong’ to the dynasty of European art is, as it were, to invade it retrospectively.\nThe decisive move from literature to painting came in 1952.\nGironella seems to have been very confident about the change, as in the same year he was instrumental, together with Vlady and Héctor Xavier, in establishing a new art gallery in Mexico City, the Galeria Prisse.\nThis quickly emerged as one of the most avant-garde of the new Mexican galleries, and the locus of a group of young artists, including José Luis Cuevas, who ‘with no fixed programme and no common plastic language,[…]were united only by the desire for change’.\nTheir discontent at this time was principally with the social realism of the muralist school but, even at this early date, there was unease with the propaganda emanating from the US that Abstract Expressionism was  the only possible alternative.\nGironella's solution was entirely individual: to focus on the art of the European past, looming large as it did in Latin American consciousness regardless of how often it had been declared dead and buried by Europeans.\nFig. 2 .\nJuan Bautista de Maino,The Recapture of Bahia , 1635, oil on canvas.\nMadrid, Prado.\nHis artistic career began with a series of paintings based on the thirteenth-century sculpture of the elegant countess of Uta on the façade of Naumburg cathedral, a photograph of which had been lent to him by the young artist Vlady, but in the late fifties he turned his attention to Spanish art.\nHis early choice of subject set the tone for his later work —— Goya's Queen Maria Luisa, and Velázquez's portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano (Fig. 3)— in other words, great Spanish artists' handling of their arrogant, ugly, bizarre or idiotic sitters.\nHe subjected both to repeated analysis, ending up with a version of Maria Luisa in which she is transformed into a sharp-beaked, staring owl, and of Francisco Lezcano in which he has metamorphosed into a dog.\nIn both, Gironella is exploring the characters of the sitters as suggested in their portraits rather than the formal, painterly qualities.\nIs Velázquez's Francisco Lezcano simple-minded, or is his expression one of aloofness and distance?\nGironella has said he was drawn to this painting because Lezcano is holding some playing cards, so his disconcertingly direct gaze is inviting us in to test our wits and/or our luck against him.\nQueen Maria Luisa, wife of Charles IV, an unlovely, clever, deceitful and immensely powerful woman, is metamorphosed into a barn-owl, a lechuza , a word which in Spanish also means an ugly hag or a procuress.\nGironella's first direct encounter with Velázquez was at an exhibition of his work at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1959.\nAmongst the works on view was the one to which he has returned most often — the portrait of Queen Mariana of Austria, second wife of Philip IV, painted in 1652 (Fig. 4).\nThis painting has become a veritable obsession and he has returned to it repeatedly over the past thirty years.\nIt is a full-length portrait showing the young queen very formally dressed, in a stiff conventional pose, looking out at the spectator.\nShe wears a gigantic wig decorated with feathers and red bows, the shape of which echoes that of the wide skirt.\nOne arm rests on the farthingale of the skirt, the hand very delicately holding a large white scarf; the other hand rests on a chair back.\nIn the earliest versions, which date from 1959 — 60, Gironella turns her into a sort of rag doll; perhaps never more than a well-dressed shell, she is now simply a collage of fragments of coarse, torn cloth that appear to be pasted  down with thick smears of paint (Fig. 5).\nThese early half-length versions, like close-up details of the original, also investigate compositional qualities, the slight angle of the torso to the picture plane and the relationship of head and wig to shoulders, as well as emphasising features which are to become increasingly fetishised in subsequent renderings — the massive wig, for example.\nAnd in the second version he introduces a three-dimensional hand not, as in the Velázquez with the fingers straight and limp, but drawn up into an uneasy gesture, that claws at her skirt rather than rests against it.\nThe hand and the wig are to become identifying features, often used in isolation or in conjunction with elements from other pictures.\nThey become relics, like the dismembered remains of Catholic saints that are boxed up and dispersed around Christendom to provide individual churches with the Church's authority.\nFig. 3 .\nVeláquez,Francisco Lezcano or El Nino de Vallecas (The Child of Vallecas), 1637, oil on canvas, 107 x 83 cms.\nMadrid, Prado.\nFig. 4 .\nVeláquez,Queen Mariana , 1652, oil on canvas, 231 x 131 cms.\nMadrid, Prado.\nIn The Black Queen of 1961, Mariana has more substance than in the early collages of rags, and so, being more tangible, is more a victim, of Gironella, of time, of historical circumstances (Fig. 6).\nIn this full-length version Gironella places her square to the picture plane, a crucial adjustment which changes the tone from that of the formality of the original into one of helplessness.\nMoving from her external trappings to her internal structure, he represents her as a sort of wooden skeleton.\nAt her breast, instead of a gold rosette, she wears a brass bell and a series of wheels and cogs, apparently parts of an old-fashioned, manually operated lift.\nShe is like a mechanical musical doll that will perform a ponderous dance when someone turns the dial.\nShe is also black.\nIn particular, the uplifted, unseeing face, and the hand, now even more tense and strained, are modelled in three dimensions and painted shiny black.\nShe is, of course, a parody of her pale, former Habsburg self, but Gironella's title,La Reina Negra , suggests a range of different resonances, as indeed it does in English.\nShe is a piece in an international game of chess; she is gloomy and melancholic; she is also, rather more strongly than in English, unlucky, wretched, doomed.\nBut conversely, in Latin America,negra or neqrita are often used as terms of affection.\nas if to ensure, however, that we cannot interpret this work as a declaration of Gironella, s ideas about race and colour in Mexico, there exists another version, almost identical but for the fact that this is a white queen.\nFig. 5 .\nAlberto Gironella,Reina Mariana , 1960, oil and collage on canvas, 100 x 80 cms.\nCollection of Maurice Reims, Paris.\nPhotograph, courtesy Galeria OMR, Mexico.\nFig. 6 .\nAlberto Gironella,Reina Negra (Black Queen), 1961, mixed media on canvas, 108 x 120 cms.\nPrivate Collection.\nIn the following year she is reincarnated, but into wood, not flesh and blood: she becomes furniture, a cross between a throne and a commode, her mask-like head and rigid hand fixed to the chair back, her wig suggested by curly iron coat hooks and carved wooden scrolls and flourishes.\nIn one version, the space beneath the seat contains a small, stuffed cayman and, as this is the equivalent of the space beneath her skirts, there are obvious psycho-sexual overtones.\nIn another there is in fact no seat as such, rather like a monk's misericord, a chair that is not a chair (Fig. 7).\nAgain her heart is represented by the mechanism from an old lift: she goes up and down as others will her.\nThe origins of Gironella's peculiar assemblages lie in his childhood.\nHis earliest memories are of stacks of colourful imported tins, boxes, bottles and packets of the family grocery business, and of the paraphernalia of popular Catholicism, which would have included reliquaries and tabernacles, retables combining paintings and sculpture, altars decorated with damask cloth, candles, flowers and ex votos of an often intensely personal nature.\nHe recalls building himself private altars of chocolate wrappers and tin cans.\nThe packaging of imported products has continued to fascinate him, for intrinsic qualities —— the names, the colours and the designs — but also no doubt because of the way products from far away have been integrated into the domestic Mexican environment.\nSuch products are known by the general term ultramarinos , ‘from across the ocean’, and to emphasise that Mariana herself is also an ultramarina , she is often accompanied in Gironella's tableaux by tins of sardines.\nThere are connections here too with Spanish Golden Age painting which, as Gironella himself has observed, often looks very smelly .\nThe picaresque literature of the period is also very preoccupied with food and drink.\nBut it is not just the strong smells of food, but the metaphorical smells of corruption and moral and social decay which are suggested by the inclusion of such items in his work.\nAnd where the tins of fish are juxtaposed with fragments of Mariana's body the evocation is also of death and putrefaction, perhaps also of coarse jokes about the distinctive ‘fishy’ smell of vaginal secretions.\nGironella's choice of Veláquez's Mariana as the basis for so many of his works is worth considering in more detail.\nFirst, to develop the idea of the punning associations already referred to in relation to the term ultramarinos , there is the pleasing assonance between the name of this earthly Queen Mariana, and that of Maria, Queen of Heaven.\nThe Virgin has always been more popular than Christ in the New World; indeed in the sixteenth century certain churchmen had argued that while the East was the domain of Christ, the newly discovered West was that of his mother.\nOnce in America, however, Maria soon fragments into numerous different Marias, each with her own distinctive attributes.\nIn Mexico, during the Wars of Independence the Virgin of Guadalupe protected the nationalist forces while the Spaniards placed their trust in the Virgen de los Remedios.\nGironella's many versions of Velázquez's Mariana similarly fragment her into different roles — queen, woman, icon, cadaver, carnival figure, victim, aggressor.\nThere is a third sister in this euphonious family: Marina, the baptised name of Malinche, mistress of Cortèz, through whose good offices and linguistic skills Mexico was conquered both for the Virgin Maria, and for Marina's royal ancestors.\nMarina is the original and ultimate traitor to her people, but as mother of the first mestizo she is also the mother of modern Mexico.\nMariana herself is remembered more as a name on a family tree than as a person.\nWife of Philip IV, she was also his niece; she had been betrothed to his son Baltasar Carlos but on his death at seventeen the King (her uncle) married her himself, and the only surviving son of this union was the cretinous Charles II, last of the Habsburg line.\nShe is also remembered because she was painted by Velázquez, although this is not unrelated to the family tree.\nVelázquez shaped the public image of this family for his own and for all subsequent generations, investing them with an extraordinary pictorial power and stability.\nHis portraits must in turn be considered an important constituent in their power, as compensation for their more corporeal weaknesses.\nWith hindsight it perhaps seems strange that one of the indisputably greatest figures in the whole of Western art devoted the better part of his life to sell-advancement, and to painting the King, his family, and their attendant dogs, dwarves and sycophants Certainly the irony of this, together with the fact that this inbred family of often considerable mental as well as physical fragility should have controlled the destiny of so vast an empire, is not lost on Gironella.\nfig. 7 .\nAlberto Gironella,Reina Mariana , 1962, object.\nPrivate collection.\nWe can read into Las Meninas such a view of the Habsburgs (Fig. 8): Philip IV and Mariana are merely reflections, living in a world of grotesquerie and make-believe; a tiny princess dressed as an adult with a skirt so stiff it makes her look as if she is on wheels, surrounded by curtseying maids, a dwarf, a midget, a huge dog with the ability to sleep through anything, and a great artist, aloof and all-powerful.\nSuch a view is of course anachronistic, but this is exactly the attraction of Gironella's reworkings — he can present us with shifting visions of the art of the past, from within and from without, exploiting contrary responses, period eye and innocent eye.\nNot surprisingly Gironella has returned over and again to aspects of Las Meninas and in particular to the portrait of the artist himself, the insider, the fawning courtier, the creator of icons.\nFestin in Palacio is one of Gironella's latter-day altarpieces, and a digest of elements from three paintings —Queen Mariana, Las Meninas and the portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano, popularly known as El Niño de Vallecas (Fig. 9).\nIn the lower register, on the altar frontal, the tilted head of Lezcano leers at us while, boxed up alongside, a disembodied head and a hand are presented as relics of Queen Mariana while above Velázquez himself, palette in hand, seems to fade into a dog.\nOn the altar table itself, in front of a piece of red damask, lies a large, realistically-modelled dog.\nThis is the dog from the foreground of Las Meninas , but here awake and ready for action, the centre of attraction and, apparently, the object of devotion.\nThe implications of Festin in Palacio are realised in a particularly horrific version of Queen Mariana of 1963,Perro devorando a la Reina Mariana (Dog devouring Queen Mariana) where she is set upon by hunting dogs who tear at her blood-red head gear (Fig. 10).\nDuring the conquest of the Caribbean the Spaniards trained packs of such dogs to kill Indians and so to wipe out whole villages.\nHere history is inverted: Mariana, Queen of the American Empire, is devoured by her own hounds.\nBut no simple anti-colonial reading of Gironella's work is possible, precisely because to denounce the \nFig. 8 .\nVelázquez,Las Meninas , 1656, oil on canvas, 318 x 276 cms.\nMadrid, Prado.\nFig. 9 .\nAlberto Gironella,Festin in Palacio , 1958, retable, 251 x 174 x 60.5 cms.\nCollection Maria Rodriquez de Reyero, Mexico.\nPhotograph, courtesy Galeria OMR, Mexico.\nSpanish past is to deny many of the elements which go to make up modern Mexico.\nThe Queen of Yokes is a good example in its complexity and range of reference (Fig. 11).\nHere again Mariana is pinned out flat, composed of disparate elements.\nHer wig is made up of bottle tops, left over from ordinary twentieth-century life, trodden into the dirt underfoot, pressed on to noticeboards.\nThe majority are painted yellow, the colour of the bottle tops on Superior , a light Mexican beer famous for its slogan ‘la rubia que todos quieren’‘the blonde which everybody loves/wants’, reducing Mariana to that Latin American cliché, the accessible, desirable, blonde foreign female.\nHer expression here is a mixture of naiveté and anxiety.\nHer carved wooden bodice suggests popular Mexican crafts, and particularly the calaveras , animated skeletons which make up her rib cage.\nThese are the central feature of the Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico, but then again skulls and skeletons are commonly used as emblems of the transience of life in seventeenth-century Spanish painting.\nThe gourd-breasts and the leather-thonged sorcerer's switch can be seen as referring to indigenous culture, as can the snakes' heads with which the yokes of her skirt appear to terminate.\nThe inclusion of these wooden yokes, the yugos of verbal associations and pun.\nThe word Yugo in Spanish, as in English, evokes different ideas:el yuqo colonial, el yugo matrimonial and el yugo de la iglesia , the colonial yoke, and the yokes of marriage and of the church, and all of these are implied here.\nMariana is yoked in an arranged marriage to her uncle, Philip IV; she, as representative of the Spanish crown, is also a representative of the colonial and religious yokes which bound Mexico to Spain.\nThe motif of the yoke was originally the emblem of Isabella of Castile, Mariana's distant predecessor, who had been responsible for sending Columbus on his first transatlantic voyage in 1492; in other words she had been responsible for initiating the whole colonial process (Fig. 12).\nIn the present century the combined emblems of Isabella's yoke (Y for Ysabella) and her husband Ferdinand's arrows (Flechas ) were expropriated by the Falangists in an attempt to claim some historical legitimacy.\nIn other words, verbally and visually the emblem of the yoke has strong resonances in Spain and Mexico.\nBut it is important that here the yokes are inverted: Mariana and the ties with Spain she represents have been transformed, translated into Mexican, into the  complexities of the mestizo Mexican present.\nShe is an essential but individually helpless cog in the colonial machine; she is pinned out like a pre-columbian sacrificial victim, bruised and blood-stained; she is a religious icon, like a popular image of the Virgin Maria; she is a mannikin from some popular religious festival.\nFig. 10 .\nAlberto Gironella,Perro devorando a la Reina Mariana (Dog devouring Queen

of Picasso.\nPicasso's extensive series of variations on Las Meninas was produced in 1957, but even if Gironella knew of them when he himself began to work on versions of Velázquez (which is highly unlikely, as Picasso's paintings were not exhibited until 1959); even though their interest in the art of the past at that point in their careers was for both, perhaps, a rejection of abstraction; and even though both can in some way be defined as exiled from their Spanish roots, as outsiders looking in —— yet the results are widely divergent.\nPicasso's paintings are principally explorations of, or developments of matters internal to Las Meninas:the light, the perspective, the angle of Mariana's head, the bobbing handmaids, echoed, for example, in the paintings of pigeons bobbing on his window sill, and so on .\nIn one version, for example, the odd position of Nicolas Pertusato's hands is rationalised by the addition of a piano.\nGironella is far removed from such light humour.\nEdouard Jaguer, when comparing the two, rather acidly remarks that ‘despite all the irritating virtuosity’ of Picasso's rendering of Delacroix or Manet or Velázquez, in the end they are one-dimensional.\nGironella is of course also interested in the formal qualities of these works, but it is the subject matter, the content, which really holds his imagination.\nDrawn to the fact-is-stranger-than-fiction aspects of Spanish history, Gironella found in Veláquez's portraits a perfect starting point for a detailed investigation of the contradictions which go to make up modern Mexico.\nHis preoccupations are unusual (if not unique, as he claims) but they are unquestionably engendered by the search for a cultural identity which lies behind so much of Latin America's greatest artistic and literary creations.\nAmbivalence towards European culture, doubts about the possibilities of finding an authentic voice, a restless search for confidence and self-esteem, these are among the many bitter fruits of colonial rule in Latin America.\nIn 1921, Siqueiros had urged artists to ‘avoid those lamentable archaeological reconstructions’(‘Indianism’, ‘Primitivism’, ‘Americanism') but he had also warned against the use of ‘archaic motifs’ from the old masters of European art ‘which for us would be exotic’; instead his advice was to study the arts of both, learning from the ‘constructive base’, the ‘great sincerity’, of the latter, and the ‘synthetic energy’of the former, to combine the ‘lost values’of the past with new values to produce an art appropriate to modern America.\nIt may not be quite what Siqueiros envisaged, but Gironella's is an authentically Mexican solution.\nFig. 12 .\nArrows and yoke emblem of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic Kings from Casa

ISBN 0 — 7456 — 0614 — 8. £8.95.\nWhat is it that makes this substantial book produce, mixed-in with its rewards and knowledge, a depressing effect?\nDoes it matter?\nCallinicos' own apology about publishing yet another study of an over-worked subject notwithstanding, it remains an important contemporary debate.\nIt isn't that; the more so since Callinicos' contribution contains a significantly original dimension.\nDespite its fashionable subject the book is in no sense routine.\nUncritical testimonials to the postmodern's attractions are ten a penny, and conservative denunciations thereof not much scarcer.\nThis study has the distinction of being both critical and radical, essentially turning the tables on advocates of the postmodern and reading their rhetoric as symptomatic of a conservative milieu's interests in a period of overall stagnation.\nIt is ‘of course’ unlikely that Callinicos' criticism will cut much ice with those whose substantial career investments lie in one or another of the postmodern's corners: movementist politics, the radical academy, post this-ism and that-ism, a variety of well-upholstered ‘dissenting’niches from both the dominant culture and traditional opposition to it.\nToo much is at stake for a book dedicated to proving the continuing value of classical Marxism to dislodge them.\nMaybe this is one reason for depression, then: that the book's well-wrought arguments will not exercise those whose ideology it dissects.\nThis indeed has already happened.\nCallinicos' Marxism has been repelled from the ramparts of pluralism for being…well, Marxist.\nIt leads to the Gulag, you know, and is patriarchal to boot(translation: Marx had a beard).\nGiven that Callinicos' book is difficult, and given the probability that despite the seriousness of its argument it is unlikely to be widely debated, I will firstly offer an interpretation of what I think its main themes are, and what they are not.\nIn the first place, as the title makes plain, if offers a searching criticism of the claim that we are living in a postmodern epoch, and the consequence of that claim, that the culture and politics appropriate to such an epoch are structurally different from those of the preceding — and now past — Modern one.\nCallinicos' criticism of the ‘postmodern’ hypothesis contains a range of emphases, the three principal ones of which are: First: advocates of the postmodern in art (which attains uncommon prominence in so far as the ‘postmodern’is powerfully underwritten by a claimed distinction from Modernism), tend to misread the modern and arrogate its defining characteristics to their own period.\nThe main ones of these are: the ordering concept of ‘doubling’—— double coding, the laying of one text over or against another; the relationship to historical codes of representation; and the relationship to popular codes of representation.\nCallinicos is able to set the claims of such postmodern advocates as Charles Jencks and Linda Hutcheon against an analysis of Modernism (predicated largely on that of Eugene Lunn) in order to demonstrate that the latter is a good deal more complex in respect of its characteristic conceptions of the subject, expression, reflexion etc, than the former are wont to have it.\nThis is so to the extent that the claim for a structurally distinct postmodernist mode of signification breaks down in the face of a variety of historical avant-garde practices ranging across Europe from London to Vienna and Moscow in the hands of such as Eliot, Joyce, the Cubists, Surrealists and others (including, somewhat surprisingly, Kokoschka).\nA further set of more qualified — or at least less wholesale — more ambiguous claims are then encountered, by authors such as Lyotard, Jameson and Lash.\nThese include: the postmodern as a tendency within the modern; a notion of the ‘sublime’ and postmodernism's related freedom from dependence on the concept of totality; a distinction between the postmodern conceived in terms of the externalised and impersonal as against a view of the modern as characterised by the internal and ‘impressionist’; and a claim that it is the characteristic of the postmodern to signify figurally rather than discursively (?).\nCallinicos' conclusion to these arguments is that despite their efforts, built around a claimed contrast of the postmodern either with or within Modernism, these authors have produced only ‘mutually and often internally inconsistent accounts’ of the ‘postmodern’, manifesting an ‘inability to come up with a plausible and coherent account of its distinguishing characteristics’(p. 28).\nIt is in fact Callinicos' later claim that, rather than occupying a qualitatively distinct position, ‘late capitalist culture represents a continuation of trends operative throughout this century’(p. 53).\nThe second main emphasis of Callinicos' critique is aimed at the philosophy most frequently regarded as underpinning claims for the distinction of a postmodern culture, viz. poststructuralism.\nDrawing on  his own previous work, as well as that of Dews and Habermas, the main thrust is initially to connect both ‘wings’ of poststructuralism — the ‘textualist’strand associated with Derrida, and the ‘contextualist/historical strand identified principally with Foucault — to the Nietzschean philosophical tradition; and then to isolate the most common problems attributed to that tradition to which,a fortiori , post-structuralism succumbs.\nThese concern: the subject; the issue of how critical resistance to dominant codes ever develops in the absence of an adequate conception of the subject; and, perhaps most fundamentally, the traditional problem facing any philosophy seeking to reduce knowledge to interests tout court , of using rational argument to prove the limits on rationality.\nThis is the densest, yet at the same time one of the most persuasive sections of the book, wherein a variety of arguments drawn from the analytic tradition are deployed against Nietzsche's lineage: Quine and Davidson on a theory of meaning both holistic and realist — demonstrating that there are more ways out of atomism and the myths of the given than Saussure's; and an anti-relativist notion of truth as a ‘regulative ideal’ derived from Tarski, Popper and Lakatos.\nThere is no space here, central though it is to Callinicos' argument as a whole, to do other than note how this perspective is then deployed not only to counter poststructuralism but also significantly to modify the position of its main critic, Habermas.\nIf Foucault and Derrida are taken to task for their Nietzschean lineage, Habermas' main weakness is deemed to lie in his Kantianism, manifest in a formalist ‘metaethics’, and his conception of ‘communicative rationality’ grounded in the consensual account of meaning offered by speech-act theory — and as such likewise vulnerable to Davidson, as well as to Wittgenstein.\nIn essence then, at this philosophical level, Callinicos is marrying historical materialism and analytical philosophy, as it were Marx and Wittgenstein, in order to defeat a range of new and old Idealisms: principally that tradition, dismissive of Enlightenment rationalism, descending from Nietzsche via Heidegger to a bathetic end in Lyotard and Baudrillard.\nCompelling as it is, however, this strategy does not form the conclusion of Callinicos' case.\nThe third main emphasis in his critique of the concept of the postmodern is to attempt to explain the hold exercised by a demonstrably deficient theory of culture and its dependence on a fundamentally irrationalist philosophy: which is to say he offers a politics of the postmodern.\nThere are two pillars to this account: the emergence in the post-war period, and more particularly in the last two decades, of a mass social layer analysable under the rubric of a new middle class — though internally much differentiated as well as distinct from a traditional petite bourgeoisie in respect of its structured ‘overconsumptionism’.\nAnd secondly, the defeat of the last major challenge to the system associated with the overdetermined name of ‘1968’ but finally petering out in the mid-1970s.\nThe latter is primary; the emergence, or at least acceleration, of the former a consequence of measures adopted by newly confident conservative states to cope with the re-entry of the world system into a succession of capitalist crises after the exhaustion of the Long Boom.\nThis kind of argument reads well in Callinicos' hands, but it is worth reminding ourselves of the unattractive reality to which it bears witness.\nA real tragedy has taken place.\nIf one only takes educational institutions such as universities and colleges, let alone the world outside, the emancipatory impulse of the sixties and early seventies has been turned inside out.\nWhat began as a compelling rejection of a straitjacketing orthodoxy made its criticism in terms of a materialist demand that the socio-political locale of culture be addressed, in the face of an institutionalised aversion to any such examination conducted under a self-serving misrepresentation of the autonomy of art.\nThis stance has now been inverted by a puritanical moralising clerisy which virtually polices conduct and enquiry in the name of a postmodern triptych — as Terry Eagleton has put it — of class and race and gender.\nWhat amounts to a fear of art, perpetrated under a false rhetoric of care and defence of the marginalised now dominates everything this oxymoronic ‘radical orthodoxy’ touches.\nAnd it touches a lot.\nMaking all due allowance for the return of historical tragedy as farce, watching this soporific monolith of the virtuous rise out of the debris of a liberating movement is akin to nothing so much as witnessing Bureaucracy emerge from the ashes of Revolution.\nIt is one of Callinicos' main concerns to relate the constellation of ideas and cultural practices trading under a conception of the postmodern condition to an inadequate and escapist politics: the claim, as one of his own critics has had it, that ‘the conditions that sustain oppression can be altered piecemeal’(Patton, cited, p. 85).\nCallinicos mordantly comments on the descent ‘from revolutionary groupuscule to single-issue campaigns and then to social democracy’.\nIn sum then, while acknowledging the stature of some elements of this constellation, such as the historical aspects of Foucault's work or the critical élan of Fredric Jameson (not to mention the giant figure of Habermas), Callinicos develops a root and branch assault on claims for the cultural distinction of the ‘postmodern’, for the conceptual adequacy of its theoretical base, and above all for the deleterious political consequences of adherence to it.\nSo far so good; or one might almost say, so unproblematic.\nCallinicos mobilises as powerful a body of argument and evidence as is readily conceivable against a variety of contemporary critics and theorists whose claims he sees, with justice, as a trahison des clercs .\nThus far there is something almost conventional about the book's stance.\nIt is possible — just — to imagine a relatively orthodox artist, critic or historian appreciating the demolition of postmodernism (if not the evidence of late capitalism's corruption and decay).\nBut this is not the argument's main thrust; and it is this rather elusive second aspect which gives the book its definitive character.\n‘Elusive’ isn't quite the word, however.\nIt is more a matter of approaching the book's arguments from within a milieu of relatively academic contemporary art theory and being unable to see the wood for the trees.\nFor the concomitant of Callinicos' critique of postmodernism is not, as it would be in half a hundred other cases, the defence of modernism.\nFor one thing, Callinicos goes out of his way to establish that the intellectual tradition he is concerned to critique is itself most fruitfully read, not as an articulation of a qualitatively new postmodernism, but an instance of a Modernist-type response.\nThus: ‘poststructuralism […$ the philosophical expression of Modernism, whose characteristic themes were indeed announced by Nietzsche’(p. 6); Nietzsche's ‘system of ideas’ is ‘in many respects a philosophical articulation of the main themes of Modernism’(p. 67).\nCallinicos is concerned to give weight to the proposition advanced by Franco Moretti in respect of Carl Schmitt, that it is not the task of Marxism to defend Modernism as if its devices were ‘inherently subversive of the existing social order’(p. 48).\nThe point is that for Callinicos, Nietzschean thought is an instance of Romantic anti-capitalism: that form of refusal of the implications of capitalist modernity which has been present virtually since the birth of that condition, described by Michael Lowy as ‘opposition to capitalism in the name of pre-capitalist values’(cited p. 67).\nThe consequence of this is that Modernism too must be a form of romantic anti-capitalism, and as such one-sided and vulnerable.\nThe principal weakness of both the modernist tradition proper, and indeed of Nietzsche himself is, for Callinicos, their aestheticism.\nIt is as well to be clear on this.\nCallinicos' defence of classical Marxism, of historical materialism, is in the first instance deployed against a postmodernism which has come to proclaim the death of the grand narrative of emancipation and the need for a new form of politics not constructed along the lines of the traditional left.\nThis defence of Marxism carries over, however, to a critique of Modernism itself: not merely for the fact that Nietzsche attaches ‘importance’ to art but for the further claim ascribed to him, and therefore to Modernism itself, that ‘the nature of aesthetic experience contains in nuce the form of understanding proper to the world itself (p. 66).\nIn the end, that is, Callinicos pits historical materialism against not merely postmodernism but, following the logic that the latter is indistinguishable from Modernism properly conceived, against Modernism itself.\nDrawing largely on the Marshall Berman/Perry Anderson debate, and thereby making of Modernism the characteristic expression of the experience of modernity, itself conceived as a response to capitalist modernisation, Callinicos seems to want to claim in essence that both the former are partial in respect of the fact of this last.\nWeber's conceptualisation of the modern as a process of structural differentiation is, I think, seen to be echoed in Modernist claims for the specificity of art.\nBoth are then held to be deficient relative to Marx's conception of a ‘mode of production’within which differentiation can be understood, made intelligible and ultimately accountable to a materialistically grounded ethics of emancipation rooted in a conception of a ‘complex’ totality.\nIt is in connection with this perspective that Callinicos was concerned to deny the common conflation by postmodernists of Modernism with the Enlightenment.\nFrom his point of view, Modernism as a sub-species of romantic anti-capitalism is one partial moment in the rejection of the consequences of Enlightenment properly understood: understood, that is, in terms of a Marxism which is itself held out as the genuine heir to the Enlightenment narrative of emancipation and its romantic critique.\nHere lies the root of Callinicos, project — the buttressing of Marxism as the ‘true radicalisation’ of the Enlightenment; and here I suspect lies also his ultimate discomfort with Modernism — prone as it is to slip the leash of a guiding politics and dance under the less biddable star of the Aesthetic.\nAt this point Callinicos has to be careful: it is one thing to dismiss the claims of a rootless postmodernism, wandering naked except for its designer trainers across the face of a barren late capitalism.\nIt is quite another also to offer a wholesale refutation of Modernism.\nAnd Callinicos is aware of this: ‘Is not the general tendency of this analysis similar to Lukács' celebrated denunciation of Modernism as ‘aesthetically appealing, but decadent’?(p. 53).\nFor fairly obvious reasons, mostly no doubt connected with the spectre of Zhdanov and Socialist Realism (but also I suspect because of a more subterranean philosophical linkage between Callinicos' endorsement of Althusser's ‘complex totality’ against Lukács' ‘expressive totality’and the political voluntarism which it informed in the early twenties), Callinicos has to answer: No.\nThis begins to be interesting, and it is I think the originary focus of that sense of misgiving with which I began.\nIf I have been primarily expository hitherto (and I have been because I believe Callinicos' book to be the best on this subject that we have) I will now begin to turn to criticism; or at least to trying to ventilate that reservation which, faced by Callinicos, certainty, will not be stilled.\nIn a sense it doesn't matter if Callinicos' defence of Marxism is registered or not by the legion of Post-isms and -ists which form the undergrowth of contemporary cultural politics.\nThey will wither at the first frosts anyway, if they come; and if they don't…\nBut with his placement of Modernism in the lineage of Nietzsche, and as such at odds with Marx  and Freud as the real motors of that ‘true radicalisation of the Enlightenment’(p. 120) which is the only way ahead, something more serious is at stake.\nTo backtrack a little, the case is perhaps not so monolithic as I have implied: for which we have to return to the detail of Callinicos' ‘No’ to Lukács.\nOn the one hand — and this is a point to which I shall return — there is a dual claim against Lukács' evolutionism (to the effect that different levels of a social formation are relatively autonomous: crudely, if bourgeois society is decadent this does not necessarily mean, as Lukács thought it did, that its art is too), and in favour of the possibility of being able to pass a positive ‘aesthetic judgement’ upon a particular work however questionable the general category under which it has been produced (a position related to Brecht's polemic against Lukács).\nMore empirically however, on the other hand, and drawing upon the work of Peter Bürger, Callinicos accepts the case for Modernism having contained a critical moment — a ‘protest against the capitalist society to which it is in complex ways related’(p. 53).\nThis is principally indexed to the claimed historical transformation of Modernism into a series of engaged avant-gardes dedicated not to the aestheticisation of life, but to the integration of art into life.\nAs Bürger has it: ‘Aestheticism had made the distance from the praxis of life the content of works.\nThe business of the new configuration was different: art ‘transferred to the praxis of life’— not however ‘to integrate art into this praxis’ but ‘the attempt to organise a new life praxis from a basis in art’(cited p. 54).\nThe ‘avant-garde’ here means, of course, constructivism, surrealism and a range of Weimar practices grouped by Callinicos somewhat misleadingly under the label ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’.\nJust how remote this stance in fact is from the aesthetic is a matter for further debate, but it is perhaps worth interpolating that the implied valorisation of the products of these engaged avant-gardes as a function of their engagement is defeasible.\nContra Buchloh et al .,\nas well as Callinicos, there is nothing as far as art (as distinct from culture or politics) is concerned which will a priori privilege a Tatlin made in revolutionary Petrograd from a Matisse painted in a hotel bedroom on the Riviera — Benjamin on technique notwithstanding (don't forget: Benjamin owned a Klee).\nBe that as it may, these avant-gardes are held to have a ‘distinctive character’ which resides in their ‘seeking to abolish the separation between art and life’.\nFor Callinicos this is ‘unquestionable’; as is the fact that the shift is enabled by the Bolshevik revolution of 1917.\n(These arguments owe much to Perry Anderson's location of the tripartite enabling conditions of the Modern movement as: a decrepit academicism; the presence of new technologies; and ‘the imaginative proximity of social revolution’.)\nFor Callinicos it is October which made the vision of social transformation ‘concrete’.\nThe downside of this, so to speak, is that the defeat of October's aspirations also marks the avant-garde's defeat.\n‘Between them Stalinism and Nazism destroyed the avant garde.\nThe political defeats of the 1930s ‘shipwreck’ the avant-garde, and furthermore, through a kind of extension (since one assumes Anderson's tripartite conjuncture fuelled even those Modernist forms which did not quite take the transformatory step into engaged avant-gardism) come to determine ‘the more general exhaustion of Modernism’.\nThe end of the Second World War is marked by the incipient commodification of social life, and as such ‘the disintegration of the Modernist conjuncture’(pp. 60 — 1).\nThe problem then begins to stand clear and I shall now have to be brief and schematic.\nCallinicos drives a coach and horses through postmodernism; well and good.\nBut the roads on which he drives it also go through most of the art produced in the last half century — shall we say for the sake of convenience, since the death of Trotsky; or in a more apt frame of reference, since Guernica ?\nI will simply have to state the case dogmatically, but: this is untenable.\nAll of Callinicos' philosophical sophistication and matchless political experience evaporate in the face of the art of his own lifetime.\nAside from the fact that he doesn't actually discuss it in any detail, there is little more than a disappointed huffing and puffing at the exhaustion of the avant-garde's shock value (backed up by a particularly crass quotation from Peter Bürger about Duchamp's readymades) and some utterly routine panting over the outlandish prices being currently paid for Van Goghs — plus a quotation from a sub-Warholian Manhattan ‘artist’ answering an art magazine questionnaire with a few smart remarks about business and producing art for the market.\nas if this were adequate to underwrite a claim for the avant-garde's loss of critical virtue.\nIn an extraordinary passage towards the end of the book, amplified in discussion at Marxism 90 in a debate specifically convened to discuss Modernism and Postmodernism, Callinicos described his experience of walking around an art gallery: ‘I have often been struck by the tedium that overcomes one while walking through a gallery of twentieth-century painting arranged in chronological order as one moves from the excitement of the early part of the century to the desperate and all too frequently sterile iconoclasm of recent artists' (p. 161).\nThe specifics aren't clear, but the contextual indications are that this would include American art from say, Pollock to André, not to mention a range of contemporary work on commodification stemming from Warhol.\nAll of which says more about Callinicos, and the limits on his knowledge and interests, than it does about the work.\nWhither Brecht now, on the lure of the good old days; not to mention the nostalgia laid at the door of romantic anti-capitalism?\nI shall conclude briefly.\nThe point is I think that the argument from here can go two ways.\nThe first response is that it doesn't matter very much.\nCallinicos, defence of Marxism is erudite and compelling, and the fact that he runs out of steam over post-war art is of less moment than the fact that he takes the range of issues seriously enough to discuss them at all.\nMost sociologists, economists and politicians, after all, don't get that far.\nThe second road is however rockier; and it is an undecided question whether its implications are depressing and frightening, or challenging and exhilarating.\nCallinicos is very careful to say, in at least two places in the book, that aesthetic judgement as to the value of a work of art is at least relatively independent of the cultural and philosophical critique of the bases from which it proceeds.\nThus, in his discussion of Modernism relative to Lukács and Brecht: ‘to highlight the fact that Modernism shares with Romanticism a ‘subjectified occasionalism, is not thereby to pass a negative aesthetic judgement on the works of art grouped together under the former label.\nBrecht's polemic (i.e. against Lukács)[…]retains all its force today’(p. 53).\nAnd again á propos Postmodernism: ‘Nor does the argument set out in this section imply the dismissal of all recent works — including those described as ‘Postmodern’—— as worthless rubbish.\nGood art can be produced in an immense variety of different conditions’(p. 161).\nThis magnanimity is precisely the problem.\nThe traffic is all one way.\nCallinicos appears to think that he can detect ‘aesthetic merit’ from the position given to him by his politics; politics, writ large, as embodying an ethics and a philosophy, is the active force.\nThus post-Second World War art is as it is —— with an ‘emphasis on the autonomous and abstract work of art’(p. 154)— allegedly because of the ‘effects’ of the stabilisation and extension of capitalism.\nCause and effect: what took place was a ‘flight into abstraction’.\nThis is a language, a world view, a form of life perhaps, wherein one of the principal reasons for according praise to a type of art is that it is able to give voice to a politics; Bolshevism in the main case, though as Callinicos acknowledges, one of the salient points about Modernism was its ‘ambiguity, its capacity to express a variety of different political positions’; that is, when it was not engaged on its more usual ‘flight from politics’(p. 161).\nArt, it seems, is the perpetual recidivist, always ducking back into the aesthetic as soon as vigilant life averts its gaze.\nWhen times are bad and reactionary commodification sets in, the deleterious upshot is ‘the recuperation of the avant-garde for art’(p. 157).\nWhen things are on the up and the lodestar of a transformatory politics shines bright, so too does ‘the avant-garde project of overcoming the separation of art and life’(p. 171).\nIn this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art.\nThe individual ‘good’ work might get thrown up, however unpropitious the circumstance.\nBut it can only be a quirk; and the force of its ‘goodness’ is strictly limited and circumscribed.\nOnly once, in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot, of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology.\nBut even this is done in the name of a supposed ‘immediate sensuous charge’ rather than any more extended critical capacity of art or the aesthetic.\nOf course, the whole thrust of the historic avant-garde, and particularly its celebration here, lies in its being associated with a liberation from bourgeois ideology; but this is not quite the same as having your revolutionary commitments tested by your aesthetic judgement.\nFor by far the greater part, the aesthetic is bracketed in the name of a robust historical materialism.\nAnd there is no room for doubt as to which is the tail, and which the dog.\nWalter Benjamin once implied something rather different.\nSpeaking against social realism in ‘The Author as Producer’, he identifies a work's ‘political tendency’ and its ‘literary tendency’.\nThe relationship he postulates is not one-way traffic; it is dialectical.\nA work ‘can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct’.\nI take this to mean that there is an equality, a reciprocity between the aesthetic and the political such that an aesthetic dimension or response can give the lie to a political claim.\nThe point of Benjamin's article seems to be to decentre the political, or at least to subject it to test, to remove those making claims for their political correctness from their habitual position of judge and jury: such that the art can, in principle, sort out the politics, and not just vice versa.\nIt is this, in the end, which I find disquieting about Callinicos' book.\nNot the vapidity of the postmodern which it reveals.\nBut the way in which the very limits of its historical materialism (which I take to be the most developed statement of the case available in English) put back on the agenda questions one had considered closed.\nThe critique of Nietzsche's apocalyptic aestheticism, with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius, just cannot be reduced to the cliché about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes.\n(Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate?\nAt least you would have to be a doctor to say so, and not a politician or an academic.)\nA requirement to minimise, even to trivialise the aesthetic — one might almost say, a fear of the aesthetic — is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here.\nThere is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic.\nBut a tame aesthetic is no friend of historical materialism.\nArt has to be more than an ornament, or a reinforcement.\nThere has to be the possibility that the politics can be put at risk by the aesthetics, or the relationship as well as each of its components will be inert.\nAn unpredictable aesthetic, it could be said, is a requirement of an historical materialism adequate to its political task.\nIf the aesthetic is genuinely to  have reciprocal leverage upon the political, certain problems have to be faced.\nFor example, what goes on when looking at, say, a Matisse in an art gallery.\nIt is easy to say that the time spent considering the Matisse is time better spent than that spent considering a Gerasimov, let alone a Bouguereau.\n(It is a terminal problem with the race n'class n'gender triptych that all these transactions are equivalently sociological.)\nBut what of time spent otherwise?\nHow to adjudicate?\nThe problem of course goes inescapably to a notion of the quality of experience (though what we are calling the aesthetic here is not, or not only, a question of intensity).\nThe relationship between, say, reading an article in Socialist Review on the bureaucracy's pursuit of revenge on Arthur Scargill, and what it is that can be got from staring at Rembrandt's nose in a late self-portrait just is open.\nOne is not a priori more important than the other.\nWhich is also to say that it is not the case that there is no connection, or that a category mistake is involved in the mere comparison.\nThe information about Arthur should bear upon how one regards the Rembrandt.\nBut the way Rembrandt's nose is worked should equally provide a corrective to rhetoric or elision in the writing on bureaucracy.\nWhich is to say, the political commentary is a form of writing.\nOr, to use an unfashionable term in these linguistic days, of thought.\nAnd it is of the utmost importance to realise that the pragmatic answer to these questions is itself what makes the revolution never happen.\nWhich latter is not however to say that ‘correct thinking’ overturns society.\nThought and organisation, or aesthetics and politics, must circle each other warily, the one never letting the other out of its sight.\nThe abyss which all this opens up is, perhaps, terrifying before it is ‘depressing’.\nI have mentioned Walter Benjamin here.\nCallinicos concludes his book by invoking the memory of Benjamin to the effect that socialist revolution in the form of an irruption into history is the secular vehicle of a redemption hitherto conceivable only in mystic terms.\nFor Callinicos it is a belief in this possibility, and that alone, which remainders melancholy and irony — that is to say, Modernism — as an adequate response to modern life.\nIt is the consequence — presumably unintended — of his argument, however, that it demonstrates so irrevocably how much this is a matter of commitment and as such beyond the reach of proof.\nOne could say that the pressing question is how it is possible to live, rather than what teleology to adopt; or at least that the latter does not sort the former out.\nBenjamin remarked, tellingly, that it is less a question of what a man's beliefs are than the kind of man those beliefs make of him.\nThis is no less an aesthetic matter than a political one.\nCallinicos, in his haste to counter aestheticism, reduces the aesthetic.\nHe has to.\nYet the aesthetic will not be reduced.\nIt is not the means to an end conceived elsewhere: but an ‘as if ’, no less substantial than the as if of revolution itself.\nValue, you say?\nPushkin eating cherries before a duel; Lenin working day in day out on Iskra; one sentence or a newspaper (the point is of course, not one without the other); Benjamin on the requirement to denature your work ‘like ethyl alcohol’ lest it be of use to the other side.\nFor revolutions may occur, but the belief that they will does not of itself ensure a better lived life.\nAs to truth and beauty — the truth can doubtless be beautiful, though it need not be.\nCertain kinds of one-way traffic, certain kinds of one-way street, are in the end not hard to negotiate.\nTheir avoidance may be more difficult by far.\nAnd there is always the possibility — the necessity?— that beauty can be its own truth.\nLike taking poison on the border.\nTHE ART OF SCIENCE\nGEOFFREY CANTOR\nThe Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat, Martin Kemp, Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1990. pp. viii — 375; 554 black and white illustrations — 16 colour plates.\nISBN 0 — 300 — 04337 — 6. £49.\nIn a heady essay written over thirty years ago, Giorgio de Santillana argued that some of the key ideas of the Scientific Renaissance were to be traced to developments in the arts.\nIn particular, the idea of space was transformed from the Aristotelian conception — a ‘tidy arrangement of a simple multiplicity of things, not unlike, let us say, the shipping department of SearsRoebuck-— into ‘a matrix for infinite potential complexities and states and tensions’.\nThe main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists, especially Alberti, Brunelleschi and Leonardo, who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space.\nWhen I first encountered de Santillana's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive.\nIts attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message, for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science.\nThey had argued that the new ideas about space and motion had arisen from an intellectual and, to a much lesser extent, empirical critique of the preceding, largely Anstotelian, notions.\nDiscussion of this transformation was confined to the great tradition of philosopher-scientists beginning with Aristotle, continuing with medieval authors, such as Oresme and Jordanus, and ending with Kepler, Galileo, Descartes and, of course, Newton.\nDe Santillana offered a very different account of the new ideas of space and a different cast of actors.\nMost importantly, he claimed that the new science was not the progeny of earlier science but the outgrowth of developments in the practical arts.\nIn his account the history of art and the history of science were intrinsically linked: in the late 1960s this was an heretical claim to most historians of science (and probably many historians of art).\nAlthough sympathetic to this heresy I found myself intoxicated but also somewhat inhibited by de Santillana's impressionistic style.\nHowever exciting his paper, his thesis seemed in danger of crumbling if it were reworked into a conventional historical discourse.\nIn the book under review, Martin Kemp reexamines the art-science relationship with much care and circumspection.\nHis style is lucid and he emerges as an honest broker who judiciously weighs the historical evidence.\nHe has an impressive command of the literature of both art and optical science across much of Europe and over a span of four centuries.\nIn contrast to de Santillana's uninterrupted thirty pages of text, Kemp's thesis is amply illustrated with several hundred plates, including many of his own line drawings showing artists' deployment of visual angles, vanishing points, etc.\nThe reader is led gently through the history of art and the details of optical science to appreciate their interrelationship.\nAlbeit less impressionistic and insightful, Kemp's analysis is of broader scope and greater clarity than de Santillana's.\nKemp identifies optics as a topic of common concern to both art and science.\n(In a sequel he proposes to pursue the role of anatomy and natural history in the history of art.)\nOf the many interweaving strands within this extensive topic he concentrates primarily on the way artists have deployed scientific ideas and instruments — these connections constitute ‘the science of art’ of his title —— while he also encompasses a number of related themes.\nThe science of art, claims Kemp, has not been adequately appreciated by art historians and to begin to rectify the situation he strives to demonstrate that ‘there were special kinds of affinity between the central intellectual and observational concerns in the visual arts and the sciences, in European history between the Renaissance and the nineteenth century (p. 1).\nIn the first of the book's three sections Kemp examines the theory and practice of perspective from Brunelleschi to Turner.\nThe second section, which is less focused and less easy to characterise, contains discussion of perspective machines and other technical aids as well as theories of perception.\nThe final section is concerned with the theory and depiction of colour.\nIn the first section one of Kemp's main themes is the relationship between theoria and praxis.\nRenaissance artists confronting the problem of portraying spatial arrangement, responded by developing linear perspective.\nThe initial emphasis was on praxis.\nFollowing the first crude attempts by Giotto, Lorenzetti and others, Brunelleschi got it right.\nThen, in the mid-1430s, Alberti the theorist codified the system.\nThe basic rules of linear perspective were now accessible to any artist.\nTheoria could influence praxis.\nThe relation between the theory and practice of  perspective over the next four centuries is examined in detail.\nTextbooks flourished making the rules of perspective available to aspiring artists.\nCodifiers produced ever more elaborate schemes for the depiction of spatial arrangements, often thereby rendering their work incomprehensible to the practising artist.\nArtists, architects and draughtsmen experimented with the new schemes since the theory of perspective offered exciting possibilities to depict the spatial relations between bodies.\nThus the eye could be subjected to precise ‘reality’, or it could be repositioned, led, titillated or deceived.\nSome of the most fascinating material in this book is provided by the uses of perspective to create illusions — such as Mantegna's Camera degli Sposi (1465 — 74) and Pozzo's dome of San Ignazio (1685).\nMoreover, Kemp hints at the diverse uses of perspective which offer a rich commentary on European history.\nIn the third and final section of the book Kemp addresses the use and theory of colours.\nHe argues that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries many artists adopted versions of the Aristotelian theory which asserted that colours are a mixture of black and white in different proportions.\nThey also often used constructively the analogy between colours and the harmonic scale.\nHowever, Newton's theory of light and colours, first published in 1672 and extended in his Opticks (1704), provided a new direction for colour theorists.\nIn opposition to Aristotle et al , Newton showed with his prism that white light is a mixture of its composite colours.\nMoreover, in the Opticks he identified seven colours in the spectrum and described a circle divided into seven segments that could be used to account for colour mixing.\nNewton's views were subsequently both elaborated and criticised.\nColour circles became ever more elaborate and orientated towards the practice of colour-mixing — witness those of Moses Harris (c. 1770) and Michel-Lugène Chevreul (1839).\nLouis Castel exploited the analogy between light and sound with his ‘Ocular clavichord’ and Goethe explored subjective colours.\nFor their part artists were experimenting and drawing on the insights provided by the colour theorists.\nDelacroix took Chevreul seriously.\nTurner, always alive to new ideas, responded creatively to both Harris and Goethe.\nSeurat paid close attention to both Helmholtz's Handbook of Physiological Optics (1867) and Ogden Rood's Modern Chromatics (1879) which, in turn, was based on James Clerk Maxwell's three-colour theory of vision.\nSuch a brief summary does not do justice to the detail and complexity of Kemp's argument.\nOptics provides a superb locus for examining the art-science relationship since optical problems, theories and constructions were integral to both science and art.\nTo admit that much is not to foreclose the question of defining that relationship since a nuanced understanding requires the command of historical detail that Kemp provides.\nViewed from the late twentieth century and the widespread acceptance of the ‘two cultures’, the search for affinities between art and science possesses particular significance for the historian.\nYet, by viewing history in this manner Kemp encounters an historiographical difficulty that he never satisfactorily resolves.\nThis problem surfaces even in his introduction in which he states that his concern is to show how artists ‘consciously aspired towards goals that we would now regard as scientific in a broad sense’(p. 1).\nPart of this passage has been italicised to draw attention to the somewhat presentist presupposition that underpins much of this book.\nIn qualifying ‘scientific’ by ‘in a broad sense’Kemp shows that he is aware of this problem.\nHowever, the presentist influence is all too pervasive.\nHis frequent appeals to ‘scientific concepts’ and ‘scientific ideas’often presuppose an unambiguous definition of science and one that is atemporal.\nThe difficulty is most apparent when discussing the Renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities Kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors.\nTake the example of Brunelleschi who, according to Kemp, introduced ‘scientific consistency’ into his use of perspective (p. 14).\nThe phrase suggests that Brunelleschi was engaging in an activity other than art.\nWas he doing science?\nAnd if so, would he and his contemporaries have recognised that in pursuing this consistency he was doing science, not art?\nAgain, how were science and art demarcated in the early fifteenth century —— socially, intellectually and institutionally?\nKemp's difficulty in defining ‘science’ and ‘art’is not confined to his discussion of the earlier period.\nFor example, in his appraisal of the eighteenth century he uses ‘scientific’ and ‘Newtonian’as predicates to create the impression of an hypostasised activity which stood separate from art and other aspects of Western culture, including philosophy.\nThus we are told that Brook Taylor, the author of the first major British work on perspective (1715), was ‘a professional Newtonian scientist’(p. 287).\nAlthough Taylor was active in the Royal Society, both predicates misrepresent this English gentleman who wrote extensively on mathematics and religion.\nLikewise, owing to his over-rigid use of categories, Kemp characterises David Brewster, the most eulogistic of Newton's nineteenth-century biographers, as an ‘anti-Newtonian’(p. 300).\nA related and equally significant problem arises from Kemp's search for causal historical relations between science and art.\nQuestions of historical influence feature prominently in this study.\nKemp frequently provides details of superficial social acquaintance between scientists and artists and refers to their reading habits.\nThis is, in one sense, unobjectionable and Kemp rightly weighs the evidence for influence circumspectly.\nHowever, the very preoccupation with identifying causal influences begs more fundamental questions about whether contemporaries shared intellectual assumptions.\nFor example, the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century was constituted not only by the new theories of Descartes, Galileo and Newton but also by new ways of experiencing the world, interacting with it and thinking about it.\nAccording to this claim, the mores of the eighteenth century were radically different from the sixteenth.\nYet this difference is somewhat obscured in Kemp's analysis by his concern to explicate the details of numerous perspective schemes and the techniques employed by artists.\nHe thereby pays less attention than he might to interpreting the science of art as a cultural phenomenon.\nIdeological and philosophical issues receive inadequate attention and yet these could have helped define the common context (or, perhaps, the contrasting contexts) in which art and science were pursued.\nAgain, Kemp's subject raises important questions about the structure and function of institutions which he only engages parenthetically.\nMore generally, a less causal and more structural approach might have been fruitful in illuminating the historical conditioning of the science of art.\nAnother example of a terminological difficulty arises in the section in which Kemp briefly examines the relation between perspective and eighteenth-century theories of perception.\nUnfortunately he predicates his discussion on the contrast between ‘empiricists’ and ‘nativists’, a distinction he soon recognises as inadequate.\nIn the light of Kemp's historiography, it is not surprising that he concludes that ideas about perception (which were often explicitly discussed by ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers') had little impact on artists (p. 237).\nWhile he has usefully identified theories of perception as an aspect of the science of art, they deserve a more eclectic and sustained analysis.\nLet me therefore mention briefly some further dimensions of the subject.\nMany artists, scientists and philosophers engaged the question of whether linear (or any other) perspective provides the true account of how we perceive.\nFor some authors perspective provides both the laws of perception and also the key to the true and rational representation of objects.\nLearn perspective and you can imitate nature precisely.\nHowever, many artists seriously questioned this wisdom.\nIn their art they combined perspective with drawing ‘by eye’; they instinctively knew when to follow the rules and when to break them.\nThis, for Kemp, is an important clue to the success of Velázquez and Turner for whom perspective was a useful servant but a poor master.\nBut artists were not alone in considering and debating the truth and limitations of perspective.\nA related point on which most (but not all) physical scientists (or, more appropriately, natural philosophers) of the seventeenth century would have agreed, was the primacy of mathematics in analysing the physical universe.\nTheir reasons for adopting this view differed somewhat, but we can take Galileo's position as not atypical.\nEchoing Plato, Galileo claimed that God had created the world according to mathematical proportions.\nThis implied that only in the sphere of the mathematical sciences can the human intellect attain knowledge that is as objective and as certain as it is known to the divine mind.\nThrough mathematics truth and reality could be laid bare and appearances transcended.\nThis metaphysical commitment came under scrutiny not only from those artists who refused to be limited by the laws of perspective but also from ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers’.\nOne of the most forceful attacks was by George Berkeley in his An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision (1709).\nHere Berkeley argued strenuously against the view that we judge the distance of objects by means of lines and angles.\nAlthough most commentators have claimed that Berkeley's principal opponent was Descartes, whom he cited as an example only in the second (1710) edition, he was more generally denying the widely-received assumption that we see according to the laws of geometry — this assumption being central to the perspectivist tradition.\n(Berkeley was familiar with perspective machines, one of which he described in a later work.)\nInstead, Berkeley sought to show that we learn to judge the distance, magnitude and situation of objects.\nThis controversial book was widely discussed but whether it was read by artists I leave to further research.\nBerkeley was not alone in questioning whether geometrical methods are adequate to account for visual perception since there was a large literature on the subject by ‘scientists’ and, as Kemp shows, artists also frequently commented on it.\nOne of the leading problems in this area was the horizontal moon illusion: the moon appears larger near the horizon than in its zenith.\nSince Ptolemy tried to solve this problem in the second century, it has been on the agenda of theorists of perception and is still, I understand, not fully resolved.\nIn the eighteenth century it was one of the main test cases for the dominance of geometry.\nAttacks on geometrically-based theories of vision (together with the deployment of such examples as the horizontal moon illusion) provide a theme of common concern to artists, scientists and philosophers and deserve further analysis than Kemp offers.\nIf there are aspects of the science of art that Kemp fails to engage adequately, the scope of this book is nevertheless very impressive and a number of the issues he discusses impinge on my concerns as an historian of science.\nLet me allude to two of these issues.\nIn the history of science theoria has usually been accorded far greater importance than praxis.\nThe general view has been that theoria is the engine driving the historical development of science and that praxis is merely the application of theoria.\nAlthough some historians, often Marxists, have rejected this consensus, only recently have aspects of praxis, such as laboratory skills, been subjected to close and sustained study.\nIn this respect the  historian of science has much to learn from an art historian like Kemp.\nMoreover, the analysis of skills provides a common topic of research for both art and science historians.\nThe second issue concerns the art-science relationship which Kemp analyses through the history of perspective and of colour.\nThe latter case is the more straightforward since he presents the impact of Newton's theory of coloured light as radically reorientating this area.\nWith perspective, the key figures of the Scientific Revolution are presented as the heirs to developments in art.\nFor example, we encounter Galileo as a bit-player who corresponded with Lodovico Cigoli over his lunar and sunspot observations.\nMore particularly, Galileo used standard perspective procedures in accounting for the foreshortening of the spots which he claimed in 1613 were on the surface of the sun.\nUnfortunately Kepler receives even less attention.\nYet in 1600 Kepler made important contributions to optical science, especially to the theory of image formation.\nKepler's concern with the formation of images was a response to a practical problem.\nHe noticed that when viewed with a camera obscura the image of the sun was too large but this enlargement was not explained by existing theory.\nInstead, he conceived every illuminated point being the source of rays spreading in all directions; a bundle of these rays (rather than a single ray) pass through the hole in a camera obscura(or the pupil of the eye).\nThus the image is enlarged owing to the finite size of the hole.\nIn his resolution of the problem Kepler represented his rays by strings.\nFor example, in ascertaining the image of a book on a distant plane, he adopted a procedure familiar to artists for almost a century.\nHe used a stretched string to plot ray paths that just grazed the book in their transit from the source of the screen.\nThis method of repeatedly deploying a stretched string to plot the light rays and thus ascertain selected points on an image was incorporated into the perspective machines described by Leonardo and Dürer.\nWhile the example of Kepler illustrates the influence of artistic practice on a ‘scientist’(which is not Kemp's primary concern), discussion of this instance would have enhanced considerably the author's argument that both the theory and practice of perspective were significant resources for the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century.\nHe also argues that, in its turn, the Scientific Revolution had some effect on the visual arts.\nMilitary engineers, who were also often mathematicians, such as Simon Stevin and Girard Desargues, contributed significantly to the subject of perspective.\nNewton is portrayed as influencing eighteenth-century perspective in an unspecified manner, although his effect on colour theory is seen as considerable.\nHowever, on Kemp's account few artists took notice of the philosophical, mathematical and scientific innovations of Descartes and Kepler.\nBy the eighteenth century there was a considerable parting of the ways since the more erudite mathematical treatises on perspective, such as those by Lambert and Monge, were of no use to the practising artist.\nEven optical instruments, such as perspective machines, the camera obscura and the camera lucida, were used sparingly.\nIt appears that once science gained its independent identity, scientists and artists used perspective for increasingly different purposes.\nAs with de Santillana's innovatory essay Kemp's book not only offers new ways of understanding the history of science and the history of art but it also raises a host of historical and historiographical questions.\nThese questions in turn suggest further lines of research that deserve serious attention by historians of both science and art.\nKemp has performed a valuable service in opening up this area.\nI hope other historians will now follow his lead.\nON THE PASSAGE OF A FEW PEOPLE: SITUATIONIST NOSTALGIA\nPETER SMITH\nAn endless adventure…an endless passion…an endless banquet.\nA Situationist Scrapbook, edited by Iwona Blazwick in consultation with Mark Francis, Peter Wollen and Malcolm Imrie, Verso/ ICA Publications, London, 1989. 96 pp.\nISBN 0 — 8691 — 983 — 8. £10.95. (sandpaperback)\nOn the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time.\nThe Situationist International 1957 — 1972, edited by Elisabeth Sussman, The MIT Press/ICA, Boston, Massachusetts, 1989, 200 pp.\nISBN 0860919838. £19.95.\nI\nThese books are both related to the exhibition On The Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Period of Time presented at the Musée national d'art moderne-Centre Georges Pompidou, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts during 1989 — 90.\nThe exhibition was conceived and realised by Mark Francis and Peter Wollen with Paul Hervé Parsy.\nFrancis and Wollen have also contributed articles (one each) both of which appear in both books as introductory statements on the Situationist International.\nBoth books are anthologies of materials by a large number of contributors.\nTheir titles invoke the Situationists' rhetorical use of long and rhapsodic titles.\nThey also denote deliberate obfuscations deriving from Dada and Surrealism.\nOn the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time (henceforth ‘the Boston text') is a film title used by Guy Debord in 1959.\nThe Situationist Scrapbook includes only two synoptical essays, the rest being made up of a selection of documents produced in various parts of Europe and Britain from the fifties to the eighties, some of which predate the founding of the Situationist International (henceforth the ‘SI').\nThese are followed by documents relating to the SI in Britain which include Ralph Rumney's Psychogeographic Map of Venice (1957), and brief statements by Michèle Bernstein which appear in the British press in the 1950s and 1960s.\nThe greater part of the Scrapbook largely consists of what the editor identifies as ‘the British inheritance’ which covers the period from 1966 — 1988.\nThe book is therefore very much an account of the movement's influence in Britain.\nThe Boston text relates more exclusively to the movement itself and includes, along with historical material, a brief statement by Mark Francis which is intended to justify and explain the motives behind the exhibition (the Situationists did not give the event their blessings and none of the past members participated in its planning).\n‘What we have sought to do’, claims Francis speaking for the organisers of the exhibition, ‘is not to reconstruct time past but to expose to the light things that have run the risk of acquiring the patina of nostalgia and the glamour of neglect.’\nIf this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the Situationist project and their condemnation of the art world.\nFrancis also implies, somewhat unconvincingly, that the event was conceived in a spirit of Potlatch and accepts the Lettrist belief in the legitimate use of plagiarism.\nThe Lettrists and the Situationists had used ‘pre-existing elements’ for their own ends, and so the editors of the Boston text and the curators of On the Passage have, they feel, a certain entitlement to do the same.\nThis legitimation in turn is related to the principle of détournement , a term which had been coined initially by the Lettrists for their neo-Dadaist practice of cannibalising pre-existent materials (in the manner of Duchamp's LHOOQ ) with subversive intent.\nMy view of the exhibition and these complementary texts is that they seem for the most part to lack the critical motivation and the dialectical irony of the Situationists.\nThey are normative representations, reverential in tone, recuperative in effect and the ideological positions which they reflect are conveniently distanced from those of the SI.\nSelf-evidently these texts are strikingly different from original materials issued by the SI in the sense that they have the status of copyrighted property and have been funded by organisations which in the past may have supported progressive art but which do not sound like the champions of revolutionary causes.\nThe Boston text, for example, is published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program, Massachusetts Council of the Arts and the Humanities, and additional funding is provided by the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund (the benefactor of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).\nThe Scrapbook is also variously supported by Association Française d'Action Artistique, the Ministry of Culture, Copenhagen, the Instituo Banco San Paulo of Turin, Becks Bier, to name some of the backers, and also by the furtively named Friends of the Situationist International, whoever they are!\nMore prosaically, the sandpaper cover (which, like the Jorn/Debord text Mémoires of  1959, is meant to damage your other books) was donated by English Abrasives and Chemicals Ltd.\nOne of the first ‘political’ statements in the Boston text is the copyright restriction notice.\nIt appears a few lines away from the plagiarised title of the book.\nThe proscription is, of course, a legal convention which we would normally take for granted, but is, in this context, inconsistent with the SI anti-copyright policy and, in the light of the Lautréamont axiom: ‘Plagiarism is necessary — progress implies it,’ which Francis cites on page 19, is an unintended irony.\nThe Boston text is more obviously an exhibition catalogue, if only because it includes a ‘checklist’ of the exhibition, which, ignoring the problematic identity of some of the works, distinguishes between works of art and other items (books, tracts, pamphlets, etc.) and also carefully identifies the status of individual exhibits by signifying their producer's relationship to the formally identified Situationist group.\nThere is another category for Situationist wannabees, which was an additional and problematical area of both books and the exhibition.\nSome of the materials in this area seemed to have the purpose of padding out the exhibition, whilst at the same time fulfilling the traditional function of consolidating the achievements of the founding group whose significance it was the purpose of the exhibition to celebrate.\nFrancis identifies the stages of the SI narrative as a chronological trajectory corresponding to (i) the Experimental Laboratory period;(ii) the detonator period (which refers to Debord's boast that he provided the explosive machinery that ignited in May 1968);(iii) the Fallout period after the SI disbanded in 1972.\nThese stages provide the logic for the ‘diachronic structure’ of the exhibition.\nIn the Fallout section are included artists, writers and others ‘who all had (sic) some contact with the SI’.\nPeriodisation and classification present some difficulties which Wollen hints at when he comments on ‘the ‘simulationist’ art boom of the eighties and its debt to the dry husks of Situationist thought’.\nIt is to be regretted that neither of these books examine the pluralism of the ‘simulationist’ period.\nTo the extent that the Situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the ‘supersession’ of art, how should we judge the Fallout period?\nThe notion of progression is clearly important in assessing this work, especially as the temptation to isolate, or even dismiss, it as an epiphenomenon of the SI is strong.\nThe materials displayed in the exhibition and reproduced in the Fallout section of the Scrapbook no doubt express ideas about which strong convictions are held.\nWhat are these convictions, and why are they not articulated?\nWhy were the exhibits left to speak for themselves?\nIt seems extraordinary that, given the political fervour of the Paris-based SI fraction in its post-Lettrist phase, the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to Debord's caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market.\nWhatever objectives the organisers might have had, the exhibition turned out to be a quite normative curatorial project.\nThe contradiction is perhaps a familiar one.\nAs Debord has commented: ‘This society signs a peace treaty with its most outspoken enemies by giving them a spot in the spectacle.'\nIt is noteworthy that the Situationists have produced nothing in the way of new projects for these texts, nor for the exhibition.\nPredictably they kept their distance.\nAt the centre of the re-grouped SI in 1961 Bernstein and Debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity.\nIt was at this time that Asgerjorn resigned his membership of the SI, although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s.\nThus re-grouped, the SI increased their political activity, eliminating all artistic production except in terms of agitational forms which meant, essentially, the use of détourné illustrations in their publications.\nThe article by Wollen is an important piece of research and a major contribution to both anthologies.\nDespite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject, it does, however, judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase.\nNevertheless, Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for André Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history.\nHe also traces the Hegelian, and Lukácsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual atmosphere after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists.\nApart from Wollen's historical and theoretical essay, the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin's ‘Dismantling the Spectacle: The Cinema of Guy Debord’.\nThis is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English.\nLevin makes a special case for Debord as a film-maker whose aim was to contribute to the ultimate destruction of cinema as a spectacularist medium.\nDebord's cinema for Levin is a paradigmatic vehicle for the movement's ‘destructive creativity’.\nThe main purpose of Levin's article, however, is to reclaim Debord for the aesthetic discourse of avant-garde cinema.\nFor example, he identifies Debord as the source of Godard's innovations: ‘Indeed, well over a decade before Godard's Vent d'Est , Debord was producing a revolutionary, materialist ‘counter-cinema’.’\nNot having seen Debord's films (he refused screenings at the ICA in London), Levin's arguments are in one sense untestable; nevertheless the article is not without difficulties.\nDefensively, he observes what he considers to be Debord's virtues and comments on the latter's avoidance of, as he puts it: ‘the various pitfalls — formalist essentialism, aestheticist myopia, politically naive fetishism of reflexivity, and so on, typical of certain avant-garde practices linked to radical political agendas.’\nNevertheless, Debord's place within a reified history of ‘political modernism’ is assured, more by virtue of what is claimed for the work than by its testing in public— Levin admits that screenings have been rare, especially outside France.\nBoth the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived.\nFurther to this, Levin claims that Debord ‘does not disparage pleasure’ and yet argues elsewhere in the essay that his films deliberately refuse to make concessions to the viewer.\nAn example of this is the early Lettrist film Hurlement en faveur de Sade , with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences.\nAs far as one can assess the merit of Levin's text in relation to its subject, it seems somewhat implausible that Debord can be all the things for which he is proclaimed.\nWhatever defence is mounted, it is clear that these films, for Levin, exist as auratic objects, and Debord their auraticised progenitor.\nHence the mythologisation of Debord by Levin, and others, has a significant bearing upon the reception of his work.\nHis remoteness and the scandal and intrigue associated with the SI have significantly contributed to the enhancement of the movement's reputation.\nLevin's essay, interesting though it is, achieves little more than assimilating Debord into the spectacularised history of the avant-garde cinema.\nHis hero-worship results in him reiterating the same claims that the cinéaste makes for himself.\nIn the opening sequence of Hurlement , as Levin notes, Debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated.\nThe tradition includes ‘great landmarks’ in film history from early ‘genre classics,(Levin's term), Expressionist, Dada, Soviet cinema of the 1920s, Surrealist, Chaplin, Lettrist and last, but not least, Debord.\nSituationist cinema is therefore important, indeed, self-important, not least because it provides ‘an alternative sort of cinematic activity, incompatible with the economy of the spectacle’.\nLevin earnestly considers Situationist film to be an effective oppositional practice.\nOne of the attractions for Levin is the persistency with which Debord, like the Dadaists before him, continued to explore the medium, whilst contributing to its eventual destruction.\nMoreover, Levin claims that the Situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions, ‘by consenting to act in culture’ as a precondition of their co-existence in the present order.\nNevertheless, cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in Levin's tribute.\nIt is like Hegel's notion of the beautiful soul which denounces the world from which it has withdrawn to avoid having to recognise the extent of its participation in its disorder.\nDebord, as a film-maker, and Levin, as his apologist, take refuge in the transcendental space of autonomy where meanings have the illusion of self-regulation and independence of the totality they represent.\nDebord takes up his place (certainly in Levin's account) within the lineage of modern masters with its attendant construction of patriarchy, distinction and causal succession.\nIn Levin's essay, avant-garde cinema is assimilated into the wider discourse of Modernist art despite their material and institutional differences.\nOne of the pitfalls of this is that different audiences and different modes of consumption are contingencies largely ignored.\nDebord's apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in Levin's emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history.\nThe blurring of art and film histories leads Levin into the murky waters of Situationist discourse on art.\nSuffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate, and lacks depth and clarity.\nDebord, for example, proclaims: ‘The critical position later elaborated by the Situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art.'\nThere is some sense in this comment which may well explain the position of the Situationists at a particular conjunction, but it is a sense which would also explain earlier avant-garde trends in art (if not cinema) since, say, Futurism.\nMoreover, the notion of art's ‘single supersession’, an histrionic claim, would benefit from some kind of historical and theoretical contextualisation.\nIt sounds important but in fact is an impenetrable statement.\nFurther clarification might also be required as to how the Situationist negation of art (and cinema) related to the wider sphere of cultural-political struggle.\nThe critique of art as an institution is continuous with earlier formations (including early Surrealism and Russian Constructivism), but Levin remains unclear in his definition of Debord's avant-gardism.\nFor Lukács and Adorno the concept of the avant-garde was a touchstone: for the one it was negative and decadent, for the other positive and progressive.\nIn Levin's account of Debord, his subject appears to hold both positions at once.\nMore specifically, on the issue of cultural hierarchies and class relations the Situationists tried to distance themselves from bourgeois notions of progress and their equivalence in the neo-avant-garde of the post-war period.\nThe SI thus rejected ‘mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession’.\nThis statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism out of which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it.\nIn fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified).\nHe does this by proclaiming, a ‘third avant-garde’, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the ‘two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord.\nHowever, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected  means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of art in the praxis of life might be achieved.\nThe reverential tone of Levin's text poses a problem which the movement's survivors, I imagine, would be quick to condemn.\nIt is, in short, uncritical in the sense of failing to site Debord's films within an adequate theoretical discourse.\nLevin objectifies his subject through the use of an argument which leaves the SI unexplained as a revolutionary organisation with the potentiality of reflecting, by its own methods, a radical social transformation.\nWhat he provides is the missing chapter in the secret history of the cinema, the missing link between Berlin Dada and postmodernism.\nAs with other contributors, exaggerated claims are made for détournement (the communication which contains its own critique), firstly because it was an inheritance from Cubism and Dada, and secondly, because, as the exhibition shows, its deployment by ‘pro-situs’ has made of it a commonplace, popularised in punk fanzines, and ‘Biff’postcards etc.\nThe Situationists' activities within the cultural sphere constituted an attempt to create a unified range of activities which functioned as a radical critique of the conventional boundaries between specialisations embedded in the institutions, practices and agencies of modern life.\nThe fragmented appearance of their work, especially its Lettrist phase, their repudiation of conventional skills and scholarly manners (evidenced in their use of personal insults) have been absorbed by subcultural milieux and in due course adapted by the culture industries.\nThe influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated (if overstated) in these books.\nIf the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed (SI through Fluxus, Heatwave, King Mob, Jamie Reid, Vivienne Westwood, and the Sex Pistols) the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence (typified by King Mob in Britain, the Motherfuckers in the USA, and also indirectly the punk phenomenon) but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life.\nThe political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large degree derives from Marx's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism, Lukács's development of this critique, and the Marxist-existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre.\nThe rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences.\nThe ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers' Council after World War One provided a ready-made model of a non-hierarchical political system.\nThe simple faith conveyed in Pannekoek's treatise recalls earlier utopian writing, and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of Situationist writing.\nWith the exception of Wollen, the contributors to the Scrapbook and the Boston text convey little concern for the forms of political organisation espoused by the Situationists, and it is perhaps symptomatic of their interest in the SI as a purely aesthetic phenomenon.\nThe SI clearly endeavoured to produce a revolutionary critique of modern life, and towards this end devised a convulsive rhetoric and an inventive vocabulary.\nThe revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this, rather than by its standing as a political organisation.\nThe remoteness of the movement from working-class experience guaranteed the survival of its bohemian image.\nIts re-emergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties Paris; a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names.\nThe Boston text reproduces old photographs of founding members.\nThe gamine looks of Bernstein and the neatness of Debord have an aesthetic relevance which signifies a rather vague, but nevertheless compelling, reason for their inclusion in the text.\nThey are not merely documentation.\nThey are in fact significant elements in the story of ‘Situationism’ which is the subtext of the book.\nThe political reticence evident in these volumes is indicated by a degree of randomness in the choice of materials and by implication a commitment to the more ‘expressive’ or irrationalist side of their work.\nIt is, for example, revealing that there is no indication in either book of the Situationist commitment to political struggles in the Third World and their critique of imperialism.\nThe introductions in both books are anodyne and brief.\nThe historical significance of the SI is not questioned, and the importance of the movement is asserted largely on the basis of aesthetic innovations which derive from the Lettrist period prior to the founding of the SI.\nDétournement and dérive (drifting) are thus reclaimed in terms of their contemporary relevance, or rather for the extent to which they influenced punk and the camp and erudite artistic radicalism which exploited it.\nWith the exception of Levin's extended analysis of film, neither the products nor any specific agitations of the Situationists and their epigones are subject to critical reassessment.\nThe short commentaries and comic imagery in the British section of the Scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions.\nSome of it is amusing, some of it pretentious drivel.\nClearly much of the material is unsupportable and there is a sense in which this is self-evident in that the Scrapbook is styled as an ‘anti-document’ which, like the films of Debord, is co-extensive with the equally unsupportable and qualitatively diminished world to which it relates.\nThe temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the Situationist project, it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal.\nThe  tendency is to ignore value distinctions and to undermine qualitative difference so that popular and high art genres are presented side by side in a unified space or text.\nThere is of course an inside knowledge which makes this ‘coherent’ for those in possession of it.\nThis presupposes the same audience separations, the same hierarchies, the same educational and class difference as before.\nFrank Mort has commented on this kind of separation between the new intellectuals who are happy and confident to mix genre and ignore qualitative and semantic difference ‘because they already know the map of Western culture’ and are distinct from those ‘who do not carry with them those levels of cultural capital.’\nHe adds to this: ‘In that sense postmodern discourse with its relativism, its denial of grand narratives and its refusal of questions of value, is a world tailor-made for the new metropolitan intellectual cadres.'\nIt therefore seems that ‘in a purely negative way’ the silence over the question of meaning in the Boston text and in the Scrapbook is perhaps not surprising —— it is an historically appropriate response to the disappearance of the SI.\n‘There is a sorrow in the Zeitgeist’ bemoans Lyotard, an inappropriateness in the metaphor of the ‘avant-garde’, and consequently a kind of absurdity attaching to the belief in art as a prefiguration of a global collectivist future.\nThat sorrow hangs over the discontinued struggles of the SI.\nThe belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear as if they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day.\nII\nWhat I have argued so far is that the Situationists are ill-served by these publications, and that this is partly due to the influence of a certain pessimism which haunts contemporary cultural politics.\nWhat I want to argue now is that there is a sense in which the symptom of this pessimism exist in the movement itself.\nThe Situationists were idealists in the sense that they perceived themselves apart from the spectacle, always managing to be ‘other-than-spectacular’, as Levin puts it, so that this became a pre-condition of Situationist practice.\nTheir self-image was that of the chosen few for whom the spectacle provided an inexhaustible supply of objects (and people) to hate, and whilst the apparent ease with which they targeted and disposed of their opposition often made good copy (the endless adventure, the scandal, etc.), there is a sense in which the hectoring tone of their documents became repetitive and wearisome.\nThe effusions of Vaneigem have an air of mystical revelation which is even more intense in recent publications.\nDebord's political fatigue is less evident but his filmwork has finished and he refuses to permit distribution and screening of his work in this medium.\nBernstein is now a journalist and works for a French newspaper.\nThere are, I think, just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook.\nThey appear in the documents section and therefore do not, we may take it, represent the views of the editors.\nFirstly, Art & Language's piece ‘Ralph the Situationist’ expresses considerable misgivings about the Situationist project: ‘The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating…’; ‘…bland incoherence — a self-contradictory absurdity — a moral ground to give up reading and remembering…’, and so on.\nWhatever gave Francis, or whoever it was, the idea that Art $ Language had anything to do with the Situationists?\nOn what basis is this reference made?\nThere is no evidence of SI influence in their work, which has quite different intellectual roots, and the article itself leaves no doubt as to the extent of their disapprobation.\nFurthermore, the inclusion of three early works by the group in the exhibition (dating from the late sixties) reveals a kind of make believe idea about an A $ L/SI connection.\nThere was no such connection.\nAs late as 1970 members of A $ L, to my knowledge, had never heard of Debord, and if they had were not the least bit interested.\nThe arbitrary inclusion of artworks in the exhibition is further evidence of a curatorial effort to construct a narrative of ‘situationism’.\nThe case for Merz, Pistoletto and Buren may be different, but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists.\nNowhere in these publications are these connections argued for: they are merely dogmatically asserted.\nGiven the withering contempt expressed by the Situationists for ‘prositus’, one shudders to think what Debord et al .\nare going to make of the ‘quasi-situationists’ discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann.\nOn the basis of her understanding, it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media (and I can think of a good many) is veritably a ‘quasi-situationist’.\nThe desire to create a pseudo-history of the movement's afterlife may be good for business, and may have provided extra material for the book (I refer to the Boston text, see pp. 10–13) but it is not in keeping with the purer aims of the Situationists outlined elsewhere in these and other texts.\nThe second critical comment I came across in the Scrapbook was George Steiner's statement from the Sunday Times in 1967.\nSteiner accepted that the Situationists had identified and accurately described the emptiness of everyday life and even accepts their pleas for subversion, but was very sour about what he described as the ‘depressingly banal’ prescriptions of Debord and the ‘turgid creed’of Vaneigem.\nChristopher Gray, one of the small number of English members of the SI, is the third commentator I found to be not entirely sympathetic.\nHis comments come from an anthology of Situationist writings he edited in 1974.\nGray's comments evoke a kind of mystical disenchantment with the movement  which he found to be too focused on an intellectual critique of society.\n‘There was’, he complains, ‘no concern whatever with either emotions or the body.\nThe SI thought you just had to show how the nightmare worked and everyone would wake up.\nTheir quest was for the perfect formula.'\nThe history of the SI is in some ways a struggle for recognition (despite Debord's evasions) sustained by a radically negative critique which ultimately failed to find a middle way between Hegelian metaphysics and the dynamics of political organisation in the pursuit of its utopian objectives.\nThe declamatory style of writing (which now seems dated) too often obscured the probity of the Situationist's critique of the alienating and manipulative effects of late capitalism and its creation of pseudo-needs.\nThe movement's critique proclaimed a uniqueness and originality for its discoveries to which it was never entitled and which served only to reinforce the self-deluding image of its own power and influence in the world.\nAnti-authoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had of course been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957.\nThe rejection of trade unionism was a common demand amongst anarchists and libertarian socialists.\nAt the end of her life Rosa Luxembourg called for the abolishment of trade unions and promoted the view that workers' councils were essential organisations in the establishment of socialism.\nMore generally the idea of the inseparability of cultural and political revolution has a long history within the libertarian tradition with its roots in revolutionary Romanticism.\nThe more direct inspiration for the Situationists was the Dada-Lettrist connection which provided the aesthetic and political basis for their adoption of non-cognitive methods of expression (such as automatism, chance and other depersonalising techniques of production) and also led to the definition of some key terms in their vocabulary.\nThe critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in Marxist debate in the twentieth century.\nThe Situationists, contribution to this was negligible.\nThe Frankfurt School's Marxian approach to cultural criticism, and production and the social effects of technology and the culture industries pre-dates the writings of Debord, and yet, despite its relative lack of revolutionary fervour remains a far more wide-ranging and thoroughgoing critique of the field.\nThe conjunction of passion and knowledge, of libertarianism and planning, of feeling and thought are conventional oppositions in post-Enlightenment thought which have also bedevilled Marxism.\nThe more orthodox theorists in this tradition have preserved this separation along the lines of a Romanticist/Utilitarian split.\nOthers have sought a reconciliation of the positions that these terms represent, and there is an abundance of literature which examines this relationship in advance of the Situationists.\nIf the Situationist project is flawed, as I believe it is, it is not because antecedent theories of libertarians, Marxists and Council Communists are ignored by them, but rather because they lacked the will to build on this tradition a systematic utopianism consisting of critique and plausible projections into the future.\nLike the Surrealists before them, their transcendence of alienation remains abstractly utopian.\nDespite revolutionary zeal, or perhaps because of it, they sought immediate compensations for the miseries of daily life, and spontaneous methods of attack which they mistook for political strategy.\nThe Situationists' strategy consisted of an exploratory utopianism — a kind of heuristic projection of a future society.\nRaymond Williams has remarked that the danger of the heuristic utopia is that it ‘can settle into isolated and sentimental desire, a means of living with alienation’.\nAnother Surrealist inheritance which distances Situationists from the more radical utopians is their blanket condemnation of work.\n‘Never work!’ announced the Surrealists.\nIt is an amusing quip (especially for those with private means) and makes joyful and nonsensical graffiti.\nBut what does it mean?\nObviously it is an incitement to refusal, and an indictment of alienated labour.\nThe refusal is as understandable as it is naive, but seems to constitute at the same time what amounts to an abnegation of intellectual curiosity about human needs.\nIts political inflexion contests the middle-class work ethic which is the main purpose of its message.\nThe aristocracy, for its part, has never needed to be convinced of the importance of not working.\nFor other theorists such as William Morris, the concept of work is not considered negatively.\nIndeed; for Morris and other Marxists the nature of work necessarily changes in the process of social transformation.\nMarx defined labour as ‘human sensuous activity’.\nLukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice.\nThe plea for an understanding of ‘totality’ in Situationist writing derives from Lukács and Marx whose critique of ‘separation’is directed exactly at the work/leisure distinction.\nAsger Jorn's interest in folk cultures and tribal societies which lacked a notion of ‘art’ as a distinct intellectual practice separated from the common culture, was based on an understanding of the extent to which the spheres of art and work have become conflicting practices within bourgeois relations of production.\nDespite this the common tendency in SI writing on most forms of directed or purposeful activity (other than agitation or ‘destructive creativity') is negative.\nThe aristocratic disdain for manual labour has its counterpart in the Situationist’ attitude to the working class considered as the moronised victims of the spectacle.\nIn contrast the Situationists' notion of pleasure is a negation of work in almost every sense of the word — a kind of involuntary idleness in the land of Cockaigne.\nTheir notion of pleasure is indistinguishable from a sixties Zeitgeist.\nIts meaning is inadequately theorised and remains largely at the  level of common sense, a crude alternative to the repressive order of work.\nNow that Situationist texts are widely available (and with these publications adding to the list) it is ironic that they seem less crucial than they once did.\nTheir appeal in the past was partly attributable to the popular texture of some aspects of the writing, its accessibility and its festive and irreverent politics.\nThese writings appealed essentially to a generation of students bored with academic life and attracted by the street credibility of the Situationists, and often provided students with the dubious pleasure of being flattered and insulted at the same time.\nThe Situationist lifestyle (in so far as it could be imagined) had some influence on the hippy sub-culture in the late sixties and punk ideology in the seventies in Britain.\nSituationist influence was more menacingly felt in France especially in the universities, although it has to be said that their influence upon the events of May 1968 has been exaggerated.\nFor the most part, however, the legacy of the movement remained less obviously political, and restricted in its appeal to fairly specific audiences in the cultural milieu and especially the visual arts.\nIndeed, the extent to which the Situationist influence has flourished in the spheres of art and popular culture is noteworthy and contrasts with the absence of the movement's influence in other domains.\nThe uneven profile of the Situationist group and its existential fragmentation together with the eclectic and impromptu formal character of the artefacts they produced, as I have suggested above, make it an ideal type for the postmodernist critic.\nThe Situationists' rejection of the classical model of left-wing monumentalism, and their apparent lack of commitment to the historical overview or the grand narrative is consistent with postmodernism.\nMoreover, the freedom with which they juxtapose theory and humour, and plagiarise for artistic effect suggests strong affinity with the postmodern.\nThe decline of the meta-narrative in favour of aphoristic models of philosophical expression (following Feuerbach and Nietzche) has been the favoured form of the Situationists.\nThe fact that Baudrillard's name has been linked with the Situationists should not be held against them.\nNevertheless, the de-Marxisation of their project by him and the ‘death of the social’ which he has announced should alert us to the doubts raised by Raymond Williams on the issue of certain types of Utopianism.\nThe concept of the spectacle is an effective term which now has a wide currency, but perhaps only in a sense which approximates its use by the Situationists.\nThe historical period which has seen its political devaluation is one in which political optimism has become unfashionable, which perhaps is one way of explaining the retrospective or merely historicist character of the Situationist exhibition, and the books I have reviewed.\nWe have seen a shift from the utopianism of the 1960s to a culture of nostalgia and, as with the more dystopian elements in postmodernism, the exhibition and the books which accompany it look backward in a search for appearances as if they were compensatory fantasies substituting for a forgotten dream."

and why is the desire to answer this question as involuntary as the response itself Why does it seem important that the answer should have some ‘objective’ quality about it an insight into history society knowledge rather than point to a merely personal obsession The American filmmaker Maya Deren says somewhere that ‘response should always precede analysis’ a remark which sounds as if it was made as an artists challenge to academic dryness and formalism But is not the response and the analysis actually part of the same phenomenon whether it results in an exclamation ‘how beautiful  or a new ‘reading’ The recourse to books documents or sources underscores a perception which is somehow already in the air The effort to recapture arts ‘history’ is always entangled with the desire to remake its identity and meaning as part of contemporary struggles This article comes out of the familiar experience of being drawn to a particular image or set of images without at first knowing why and the attempt to account for this feeling Looking intermittently at the socalled colonial art of Latin America in churches museums private collections and books I became magnetised by the figures of angels They are extraordinarily resplendent They have a material splendour in their dress The spiritual or is it the psychic intensity of their presence goes together with a marvellous air of freedom and delicacy They have a tendency to expand to fill the picture space If the angel is already a hybrid a human with wings the Latin American angels seem to incorporate further incongruities into this composite of the human and the supernatural which hints at further latent meanings I knew that these paintings were produced for the Spanish in the decades after their conquest of Latin America and represented the christianising of the old centres of Inca culture in Peru and Bolivia especially I knew that in the main they were painted by Indian and mestizo artists at the command of the Europeans It lodged in my mind to try and answer the question as to whether there was something special about the depiction of angels in postconquest art and if so what it could be I didnt make a systematic study but I occasionally followed up clues if I came across references in books and catalogues I soon learned that the theme of angels was one of the most popular in the paintings produced by indigenous artists for the complex iconographic programmes of the churches and missions established by the Spanish after the conquest This word ‘popular’ is of course problematic and will be returned to a little later All colonial painting began in a process of copying Indian artists were obliged or forced to abandon their own forms of representation and learn the European way But after a period of sheer copying some themes took off Some developed differently in the American context Why did angels especially flourish As I investigated further it seemed to become clear that if this question could be answered it could only be in a complex way These paintings in other words could only be read as the site of a complex play of forces They were not simply transcriptions of the power of the conquerors and the coercive force with which they attempted to annihilate the existing culture and beliefs of the Indians and impose Christianity Nor obviously were they a simple expression of Indian resistance to this assault In some way they were both these things at once The more I looked into it the more the paintings seemed to go beyond simple unitary ideas of authorship and meaning The Peruvian art historian Luis Enrique Tord has written The Spanish conquest of the Inca empire had a profound impact on many aspects of Indian society but by far the most serious blows suffered by the Andean peoples were administered by the Church The efforts of priests and missionaries to eradicate the Indians ancestral beliefs produced profound emotional disturbances as well as great changes in their conception of the world To enforce conformity to the new orthodoxy the Spaniards instituted ecclesiastical visitas  or inspections intended to extirpate the idolatory that persisted long after the conquest In the sphere of art the range of subjects and genres permitted by the church was extremely narrow only in fact religious paintings and portraits At that time after the conquest there was effectively no ‘thought’recorded discourse outside the religious framework and institutions The first university in Peru for example was founded by the Dominicans Painting was from the beginning one of the most important instruments of conquest in the sphere of thinking the mind In the earliest years of their missionary efforts Dr Tord writes the friars discovered that the Indians were deeply impressed by sacred images created with the newest artistic techniques brought from the Old World… Those images were first seen in the catechisms Bibles books of hours and hymnals used to convert the Indians and direct their worship ‘The Archangel Raphael’ by a follower of Luis de Riano Cuzco School c 1640 Oil on canvas 65″ x 42″ Convento de San Francisco La Paz The Jesuits brought over their leading painter in Europe in the late sixteenth century the Italian Bernardo Bitti to live and work in Cuzco A school of painting grew up in Cuzco which became the leading centre of the production of paintings south of Mexico and exported paintings and painters to many other parts of the continent including remote areas Leopoldo Castedo the SpanishChilean art historian writes Of fortyseven painters documented in Cuzco during the period thirtyfive were Indians seven criollos or mestizos four Spaniards and one Italian This list does not include the great number of Indians who remained anonymous… The similes usually used to describe the stylistic hybrid produced over the years by the Cuzco painters — the ‘melding’ or ‘blending’ or the ‘intricate amalgamation’ of European and indigenous traditions to produce an art of ‘Byzantine richness and splendour’— obviously belies the violence of events These phrases do however have the ring of truth in an aesthetic sense — or rather there was an aesthetic process involved which had to some extent its own story This was manifested not only in the precise artistic and critical response by Indian peoples to European paintings but also in connoisseurship within the colonising ranks A blossoming of the arts followed the rebuilding of Cuzco after the catastrophic earthquake of 1650 partly due to the arrival of Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo His collection included two El Grecos and other outstanding Spanish pictures and he sponsored Indian painters like Diego Quispe Tito as well as sculptors architects and jewellers Sometimes the coercion and oppression is felt directly in the paintings for example in images of Saint Isidore a rather obscure Spanish saint vastly amplified in the New World as the patron of labourers who is shown to carry a small bag of coca leaves as the Indian peasants and miners did and do to chew to combat hunger and fatigue Castedo points this out He also shows that images of Santiago St James staying the moors were often changed to Santiago slaying the Indians  Indian painters would in this case be painting an image showing the Churchs and the States warning to Indians who contemplated rebellion as many did And occasionally as for example during or around the time of the rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II in 1780 an image would appear of explicit resistance to colonialism In the somewhat unlikely context of the Pelican History of Art the relevant volume is Art and Architecture in Spain and Portugal and their American Dominions 1500–1800  an anonymous painting is described which shows America nursing Spanish noble boys Negroes and mestizos are pressing around her throne while nude Indian children weep abandoned Two richly dressed Indian couples present their gifts in a beautiful park crowded with different animals The legend says Where in the world has one seen what one sees here… Her own sons lie groaning and she suckles strangers The images of angels are much more ambiguous and capable of different interpretations this could of course be said of the angel theme generally as it recurs in the history of art and in various guises across different cultures It is not hard to find documentary evidence for the Churchs deliberate use of the angel theme as an instrument of conversion The Bolivian art historian Teresa Gisbert writes that the Councils of Lima which were responsible for questions of orthodoxy in the Viceroyalty ‘sought to attract Indians to the new faith by the use of images which would be especially appealing to them Why were angels appealing to them In the Pelican History Martin Soria tentatively puts forward the theory that angels were popular because ‘they replaced similar messengers in preconquest beliefs’ Teresa Gisbert produces evidence to show that Diego Quispe Titos series of paintings of the zodiac for the Cathedral of Cuzco was commissioned in order to counteract the traditional indigenous worship of the stars and were intended to aid in Christianising the Indians of the Andes And she suggests that the angels especially the series of angels could have a similar purpose to ‘replace worship of celestial phenomena with the theologically acceptable cult of the angels’ So apparently they were ‘popular’ for different reasons with both Christian and native American with oppressor and oppressed It is as if you could read in them simultaneously transcriptions of inducement threat coercion protection solace yearning and resistance Does this explain their complex expressivity For the same quality can be interpreted differently according to ones point of view ones experience and ones feelings Protection can mean Defence of the Faith ie of Christianity or it can mean the adoption and identification of a ‘guardian spirit’ who will watch over your lifejourney a universal but at the same time very individual and personal desire expressed in most religions and cultures Looking at the angels image you can dream ask for what you want The angel with its brilliantly opulent but light clothing its mobility its freedom from hierarchical placing in the pictorial composition and its bisexuality is an intimate image of enablement Among the images of angels is a genre apparently unique to South America even to the Andes the Angels with Guns This was also a very popular subject one church inventory for 1748 for example lists 36 pictures of armed angels Julia P Herzberg who calls these pictures ‘representations of winged  beings at once military aristocratic and religious gives this explanation of their raison dêtre Paintings of angels with guns appeared at a time when the religious orders were confronted with the stubborn persistence of preconquest religion amongst their Indian charges Immense problems remained not merely in the campaign to destroy Indian idols but in teaching and reinforcing the principles of the new faith Sermons and catechisms were of course the primary means of conversion but images of angels with guns were useful symbols of important teachings of the church The Spaniards conquered the Incas with both the Cross and the arquebus The key to understanding the religious function of these images is found in the gun motif Firearms unknown to the Indians at the time of the conquest seemed a frightening manifestation of the supernatural for they ‘fled out of fear when there was a blare of trumpets the roar of arquebuses and artillery’ The firearm in an angels hands must have had a powerful impact on Indian converts But since guns were also used defensively the images functioned symbolically as reminders of the protection offered to those who embraced Christianity The image of the angel with a gun served a secular as well as a religious function by emphasising the lesson that the Church and the Spanish colonial régime were united in their goal to christianize the Indians The military aspect of the crusade is subliminally suggested by the gentle figure who handles his firing weapon in varied positions which recall those of a fighting force In speaking about the angels clothing Herzberg continues Far more important than the military aspects of the angels costumes are the explicit references to the high social status of both Spanish colonial gentlemen and Inca royalty Richly brocaded fabrics ribbons and lace characterize the opulent viceregal dress of the 17th century The gentlemenaristocratic nature of angels with guns is defined by their elegant dress which relates them directly to the ruling viceregal aristocracy A key phrase here seems to me to be ‘gentle figure who handles his firing weapon’ Although the technical military details of loading and handling the gun and so on of the angel paintings is very precise — taken in fact from a Flemish military manual of 1607 — the ‘common soldier’ of the image in the manual is not retained he becomes the gorgeous aristocrat The nonaggressive angellike  pose is of course extremely seductive which makes the threat of force oblique only implied as if a beautiful face was being laid over the ugly face of violent coercion Are these pictures simply transcriptions of power in which the hard approach is mixed with the soft and the Church is allied with the State and in this case hinting as well not just at the foreigners domination of the native inhabitants but also at class conflict within colonial society since the angel is a mélange of Spanish and Inca aristocracies Perhaps But again they seem to me more enigmatic more multiple — images full of aesthetic tensions Can one again make a conflation between domination and rebellion in the image an expression of both the ChurchState and the Indian wishes Leopoldo Castedo writes The prestige of the armed archangel was and is still very great In mestizo architectural decoration of the 18th century the archangel brandishing the flaming sword had a prominent place particularly fine examples are in the Cathedral of Puno and San Lorenzo in Potosi and in the traditional diablada boliviana Bolivian devil play a religious drama the Archangel Michael defeats …the Devil of the Seven Masks In 1950 in a curious or consistent coincidence as Castedo Pointedly calls it  Pope Pius XII declared the Archangel Michael patron of police — a decision that may well diminish the archangels prestige in Latin America ‘Archangel with Gun’ by an anonymous painter of the Cuzco School early 18th century Oil on canvas 63 14″ x 39 12″ Museo de Arte Lima ‘Archangel with Gun’ by the Master of Calamarca José Lopez du los Rios Lake Titicaca School c 1684 Oil on canvas 63 58″ x 46 12″ Museo Nacional de Arte La Paz Aside from dealing as I have been doing with one of the major subjects and themes of Cuzco painting an inventory could be made of ways in which painters departed from European models or from academic notions of excellence There are peripheral insertions like borders of flowers or tropical birds which populate the background landscapes of many religious paintings Or survivals at the level of colour liking for flat and intense colours local earth and vegetable dyes which may go all the way back to the ancient textile traditions such as that of the Paracas culture in Peru Also intensification of the colours in the angels wings as compared with Europe These questions were not merely ‘academic’ Disputes among Spanish and Indian painters themselves in some ways antecedents of all subsequent debates around ‘indigenism’ go back to the early days in Cuzco In 1688 the Cuzco guild of painters split The immediate reason seems to have been that Indian painters working for some of the Spanish and criollo masters complained of mistreatment The Spanish admitted their guilt but no agreement could be reached and the two sides moved apart The Spanish guild tightened its European rules of style The Indian painters lost contact with European developments and according to Teresa Gisbert ‘sought inspiration both in the old styles and in their own tastes and traditions’ a mixture of ornamental stylisation with observation of the reality around them Their religious pictures she writes ‘belong to an archaic world … who viewed the religious realm as something ‘different’ from mundane reality The argument so far has been intended to put forward the possibility that an art work or image could be official and coercive and unofficial and subversive all at the same time The example I have given is by no means the only one that exists The  same process has been documented in other situations where a people have been conquered colonised and their cultural beliefs assaulted Eduardo Mondlane found that African carvers in nineteenthcentury and early twentiethcentury Mozambique had made their own use of Christian themes imposed by priests and missionaries When a makondesculptor departs from the stereotype … this is nearly always because an element of doubt or defiance has been worked into it a madonna is given a demon to hold instead of the Christ Child a priest is represented with the feet of a wild animal a pietà becomes a study not of sorrow but of revenge with the mother raising a spear over the body of her dead son Magazine advertisement featuring a painting by Botero Such images may startlingly demonstrate the general truth that the meaning of a work cannot simply be equated with its subject But particularly intriguing is the phenomenon of syncretisation itself as an artistic process and its relationship to meaning the process whereby something new is created that cannot simply be reduced to either side of two antagonistic forces or returned to a former ‘purity’ A new ‘inbetween’ is created This is especially true in the context of Latin America where this kind of duality and fusion has been a feature of culture from the time of the conquest right up until today — both on the popular and the intellectual level ‘Latin America is such a syncretic eccentric disjointed fusion of European Amerindian and AfroCaribbean culture’ in the words of the Mexican artist Guillermo GomezPeña Or as the Chilean painter Juan Davila recently put it ‘You take something of yourself something of the conqueror’ In both cases these are intellectuals talking about their own work by linking it with a process continually taking place at a popular level and in everyday life Today the image of the angel is still alive and still in contention it has by no means been merely consigned to the museum It is still a part of contemporary power struggles On the one hand it has appeared as a focus for resistance The militant angel appeared for example in wall paintings in Haiti during the shortlived popular uprising for food and democracy of 1986 The extraordinarily effective popular figure of the masked Superbarrio who emerged spontaneously to lead the movement to demand the provision of proper housing in the aftermath of the disastrous Mexican earthquake of 1986 surely appeals to memories of the angelenabler along with references to Mexican popular masked wrestling heroes and perhaps to Superman At the same time the armed angel is continually reproduced as a figure of folklore a naive stereotype of Latin America typically exploited in the paintings of Fernando Botero the highest selling Latin American artist in the world today His shallow humour trades in but misses the actual drama and sensibility of that hybrid fusion of the aristocratic and the popular which took place all those years ago in Cuzco Symbolic angel lances a Tonton Macoute on a mural in PortauPrince Haiti 1989 Photo by Pablo Butcher An Inca Warrior in the guise of the Archangel Michael with a flaming sword Stone carving in a church at Potosi Bolivia 18th century ‘Popular culture is not what is technically called folklore but the popular language of permanent historical rebellion’ This sentence by the Brazilian filmmaker Glauber Rocha written at the turn of the 1970s clearly identifies a form of expression with a mass of oppressed people whose experience has been continuous over at least four centuries And Glauber also implies that the forms and images in which this experience is expressed are not fixed but open and changing The sentence comes from an essay called Eztetyke du Rêve  an eccentric spelling of Esthétique du Rêve ‘Aesthetic of the Dream in which building on the idea that ‘the dream is the only right which cannot be forbidden’ Glauber Rocha described how he had come to realise the revolutionary importance of the mystical in Latin American popular culture It was the only way of contesting that ‘bourgeois reason’ which for him was as much a feature of leftwing political programmes as it was of traditional colonial domination In his 1965 article ‘Aesthetic of Hunger’ enormously influential on Third World cinema and art Glauber felt he had given ‘the measure of my rational understanding of poverty’ By 1971 he was saying that as artists We must touch by communion the vital point of poverty which is its mysticism This mysticism is the only language which transcends the rational schema of oppression The role of the angel as an intermediary between the human and the mystical world and its elaborate beautifying as a vehicle of the dream would seem to tie in closely with Glaubers identification of a continuing thread of psychological resistance in Latin American culture The writer would like to express his appreciation of the art historical studies of Teresa Gisbert Leopoldo Castedo Julia P Herzberg and dr Luis Enrique Tord to which he has been deeply indebted in writing this article  ‘HER DRESS HANGS HERE DEFROCKING THE KAHLO CULT Oriana Baddeley The 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishments attitudes towards art produced outside of its traditional parameters The work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced out of the ‘modern masters’ market Almost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain — graffiti art Soviet art Australian art the art of Latin America The major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago The current status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic example of this change Once known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera her reputation outside of Mexico now far supercedes his since 1919 sale room estimates of her work have risen from 40000 to over 1 million and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke all records at Sothebys New York for a Latin American artist The enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content While the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen it was the publication of Hayden Herreras biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status Since that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries a feature film ‘Frida’ by Paul Leduc a stage play numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing In May 1989 Elle magazine ran a 16 page feature on Frida Kahlo as the ‘spirit of Mexico’Fig 1 while in Vogue Feb 1990 there was a 10 page interpretation of ‘the romance of Frida Kahlos Mexico’Fig 2 Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna already a devotee of Kahlos work was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlos life Fig 1 Elle Magazine  May 1989 p 18–19 As with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of Kahlos admittedly fascinating life The passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera her flamboyant appearance but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work While Kahlos art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art In this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of Van Gogh a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death The archetypal dropoutspiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990s long hot summer Yet despite the iconic status of Van Goghs ‘tragic’ life it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified his thick impasto brushstroke his vibrant yellows the urgency of his creative drive In the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself the characteristic brows the elaborate hair the Mexican costume Fig 3 It is primarily her appearance not the formal language of her art that has graced the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines The Elle feature transposed the ‘Kahlo style’ to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herreras biography of  the artist In the later Vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their ‘Mexican’ interiors There is a poignant irony in the way clothing which on one level served to hide Kahlos broken body falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique Fig 4 The visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work In both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself exotic passionate yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit While Elle Vogue and subsequently The Independent Fig 5 stressed different facets of Kahlos public persona they all shared the emphasis on ‘her’ as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of Mexico rather than her work It is her body as the canvas her appearance as art The art of selfexpression becomes selfexpression as art Fig 2 Vogue  February 1990 p 130–1 Fig 3 Elle Magazine  May 1989 p 28 Of course the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlos case The majority of her work is self portraiture her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance Dressing up role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlos work In SelfPortrait with Cropped Hair 1944Fig 6 she paints herself wearing Riveras suit challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority while simultaneously threatening castration More disturbingly in The Mask 1945Fig 7 she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her selfportraits as revealing of her inner emotions Where does the mask fall Does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features ‘mask’ far more than it uncovers There is however an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933 ‘…some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‘a la Mexicana’ but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible The ‘impossibility’ stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlos choice of clothing a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances The particularities of postrevolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avantgarde For Kahlo however choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana as for example in Tree of Hope 1946Fig 8 was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity Mexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific varying from region to  region The Tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to preHispanic forms of clothing It is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlos choice The ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led to the adoption of the Tehuana in postrevolutionary Mexico as the image of the strong Indian woman the undefeated counterpart to the despised ‘Chingada’ who conversely is the female embodiment of Mexicos hybrid postconquest culture In a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict the Tehuana represents that aspect of Mexicos indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule Kahlos adoption of Tehuana dress while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body asserted both a feminist and an anticolonialist position Fig 4 Vogue  February 1990 p 138 Fig 5 The Independent on Sunday  8th April 1990 p 37 In Kahlos work there is a powerful mix of these discourses yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work It is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved Her work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a womans art The fascination with functions of the body the analogies between artistic  and physical creative processes selfportraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s Fig 6  Frida KahloSelfportrait with cropped hair  1940 40x279 cm Museum of Modern Art New York Fig 7 Frida Kahlo The Mask  1945 40x305 cm Coll Dolores Olmeda Fig 8  Frida KahloThe Tree of Hope  1946 559x406 cm Coll Isidore Ducasse Fine Arts Inc In their formal language Kahlos works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments the adoption of the decorative the intimate and nonfine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of ‘high art’ This ‘appropriateness’ of Kahlos aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context to stress the collective and the crosscultural Although this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic it has diminished the complexity of Kahlos achievement as a specifically Mexican painter operating within the particularities of her historical moment More problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her ‘Mexicanness’ as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by Breton as a ‘ribbon round a bomb’ It is the ribbon that runs through the pages of Vogue  the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work such as Kahlos The Suicide of Dorothy Hale 1939Fig 9 In this painting a memorial to a womans tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her Hales suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of New York and North America in general The story behind Hales death was one with which Kahlo obviously identified and within which dress formed an important symbolic function Before jumping from the window of her apartment Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer In Kahlos painting the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street literally coming down to earth Hales eyes stare knowingly at the viewer a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture The horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building She leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world Although destroyed she has also escaped The painting dedicated to Hales mother was commissioned by a mutual friend of Kahlo and Dorothy Hale the managing editor of Vanity Fair  Clare Boothe Luce The painting was agreed to by Luce in part to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend Having lent Hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an hautecouture dress and refused to turn up to what in retrospect became Hales farewell party Later it was revealed that the money had come from a different source A male friend had tried to dissuade Hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy ‘the most beautiful dress in New York’ telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband On one level this work deals with a generalised ‘womans experience’ yet the metaphorical power of Dorothy Hales dress derives from Kahlos use of clothing in her own selfportraits Dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses Hales black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the ‘Gringolandia’ so hated by Kahlo In those paintings where Kahlo wears European dress she is passive weak and unable to control her own destiny but in the Tehuana costume she is strong powerful hopeful Unclothed her body becomes yet more vulnerable but as Jean Franco states The unclothed body is not a ‘self but a socialised body a body that is opened by instruments technologized wounded its organs displayed to the outside world The ‘inner’ Frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed Frida who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer Kahlos naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of Mexicos colonised past La Llorona ‘the weeping woman’ of popular myth and La Chingada the raped and abused mother described in Pazs The Labyrinth of Solitude  Descended from an Aztec mother goddess Llorona is a longsuffering mother figure symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the  Spanish invasion Driven mad with grief by the loss of her child she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the preConquest past At its most simple La Chingada as the mother of Mestizo culture is ‘the Mother forcibly opened violated or deceived’ The female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the Spanish invaders The Indian Mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child The rhetoric of the Tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance Fig 9  Frida KahloThe Suicide of Dorothy Hale  1939 581x475 cm Phoenix Art Museum

photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of North American culture Kahlo does not appear in the work her Tehuana costume hangs empty in the centre of the composition suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy On one level My Dress…is a coda to SelfPortrait on the Borderline 1932Fig 11 of the previous year This small painting on metal in the style of a Catholic votive image shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist North America and the archaic fertility of Mexico Interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America This is done by a series of juxtapositions the past versus the present female nature versus masculine technology growth versus exploitation and in its very material presence the traditions of fine art versus the popular At the same time the ambivalence of her own and modern Mexicos position is manifested in the figure of the artist The paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand The red and green of the Aztec necklace links it compositionally with the indigenous plants to the ‘south’ of the painting the pink colonialstyle dress tonally blending with the skyscrapers to the ‘north’ My Dress …again suggests a conflict but the ambivalence is gone

work presents a bleak view of urban alienation The Church Wall Street and Industry are joined by a network of telephone lines forming a remorsely inhuman environment Beneath this manmade mechanism of oppression are the people literally distanced from their surroundings by Kahlos use of photocollage In the forefront of this scene flutters the dress incongruously vibrant despite its suggestion of loss Dislocated from its political context it hangs like a piñata above the teeming streets of the city decorative yet potentially explosive There is no place ‘there’ for the values the Tehuana dress represents its folds are given meaning by Kahlos search for a cultural identity Within the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest a reminder of political alternatives The physicality so characteristic of Kahlos work is missing no flesh no blood just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost Liberty The interrelationship of body and dress so selfconsciously referred to in many of Kahlos most polemical works Fig 12 has been strangely inverted by her current popularity Her ‘Mexicanness’ has become a stylistic gloss decorative colourful pretty even individualistic The colonised body which Kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering What is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing in both art and life that Kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history Fig 11  Frida KahloSelfPortrait on the Border  1932 33x458 cm Coll

Fraser It is a truism to say that that which cannot be readily classified will tend to be overlooked In Art History the rehabilitation of artists and bodies of work which have been overlooked has been going on since Vasari made such a good job of classifying Florentine art that all other art in Italy and beyond has had to be defined at least until this century and at some level even now in relation to Vasaris classifications or at least in relation to the model of stylistic evolution which he outlined NonItalian artists nonItalian preoccupations women artists artists working in media other than Vasaris chosen painting sculpture and architecture nonWestern art and so on critics have been busy reviewing such areas and in so doing producing new categories and classifications Latin American art has been undergoing such a review both from within Latin America itself and from elsewhere with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in Europe and the US That there should be an issue of the Oxford Art Journal devoted to Latin American art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts But new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive Within the field of Latin American art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern In the case of the work of the Mexican Alberto Gironella the reason would seem to be precisely because of his insistent concentration on art of a very different category — that of Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries particularly court portraiture Among the more comprehensive books on twentiethcentury Mexican art in recent years Shifra Goldman only mentions him in passing Luis Cardoza y Aragón says little more than that Gironella ‘escapes him’ and Ida Rodriguez Prampolini dismisses him from her discussion of Mexican surrealism as an ‘international’ artist more closely related to Spain than to Mexico When he has inspired sympathetic coverage the results tend to be not so much an exposition of Gironellas achievements but belong to that particular branch of literature which uses works of art as a starting point for literary excursus Octavio Pazs elegant essay is the prime example where despite some insightful remarks he uses Gironellas work to make general observations about the creative role of the critic for example or for digressive flourishes on Spanish culture When they met in Paris in 1963 Breton hailed him as a surrealist but in a recent interview Gironella disclaimed so tidy a classification saying he is as much a baroque artist as a surrealist In fact although there are both surreal and baroque elements in his work Gironella prefers to call it mestizo’ a term which has often had negative racist overtones but which has been acclaimed in this century especially in Mexico as a positive value indeed the distinguishing feature of Mexican culture the rich and fruitful mixture of the European with the indigenous American This rather simple notion that there is one single Mexican culture problematic principally because it tends to valorize the European over the indigenous and to ignore the diversity and richness of the latter but also conversely because it excludes or denigrates the more purely European aspects of the culture Nevertheless it seems to me that Gironella is right or that he is right in so far as he is using ‘mestizo’ to claim for his work a Mexican not a European identity He is probably also right when he says that he is only seen as a Spanish artist because his interest lies in Spanish art instead of in French art ‘like everyone else in other words within the accepted categories there is no room for a Mexican who is interested in Spanish art My purpose in what follows is to try to place him within a Mexican context Gironellas subject matter is the acclaimed artistic masterpieces of the Spanish past which he reworks in various ways most dramatically into ironic altars assembled from a variety of painted sculpted and readymade elements Fig 1 Favoured subjects are court portraiture and allegorical images of death decay and the transience of life usually handled with the blackest of black humour Favoured artists are Goya and his predecessors in the Golden Age —— El Greco Pereda Valdés Leal and above all Velázquez It is worth emphasising that the period spanned by the lives of El Greco and Velázquez saw in Latin America the consolidation of colonial government and of the Christian church the establishment of the Spanish language and of European culture the introduction of new methods of exploitation of people and resources Goyas life on the other hand coincides with the decline and ultimate collapse of the Empire Spanish rule in America had been overthrown by the time of his death in 1828 In other words these artists lived during Latin Americans formative years the work of the artists who interpreted their historical reality on to canvas but the importance in Latin America of the art itself should not be underestimated particularly the iconography of the monarchy Velázquezs name for example would have been familiar to very few Mexicans in the seventeenth century but as the only artist authorised to execute likenesses of the King his official portraits of Philip IV and the innumerable engravings after them would have been well known A painting by his contemporary Juan Bautista MainoThe Recapture of Bahia  of 1635 represents the recapture of the harbour of Bahia in Brazil then under Spanish control from the Dutch in 1625 Fig 2 While an injured man is tended in the foreground the Dutch forces to the right kneel in homage before an allegorical tapestried portrait of Philip IV This is a highly unusual painting in a number of ways not least because no such royal portrait could ever have existed including as it does and on almost equal status with the king the figure of his ambitious minister the CountDuke of Olivares Nevertheless on special occasions the Spanish authorities in America would certainly have erected large representations of the king in this manner as objects of semireligious devotion On the death of a member of the royal family elaborate catafalques were constructed in cathedrals throughout the Empire and the deceased mourned in effigy Paintings and prints were distributed to colonial officials for display in much the same way as British embassies are provided with an official photographic portrait of the Queen In other words the focus of Gironellas attention is neither historically nor iconographically arbitrary although in some ways his reworkings of the paintings of others could be seen to be simply an extension of a fairly conventional activity Within the Western tradition of art we tend to take it for granted that much can be learned from the study of the art of the past and traditionally copying from the works of the Great Masters was one of a young students most important tasks This activity this dependence on the art of the past is not in itself ideologically highlycharged Reynolds may have admired and borrowed from Michelangelo and while this could be said to represent perhaps a longstanding tradition of cultural domination — or the domination in England of the Italianate tastes of the English upper classes — it would be a mistake to make too much of this In the case of Latin America it is more complex Historically the relationship between Latin America and Europe is not only one of cultural domination of the former by the latter but of political and economic domination While the obvious colonial ties have been broken the power still lies elsewhere The sources of domination have in some ways simply broadened to include the US japan and international capitalism Within the art world the problem remains that the production of art in Latin America from a students training to the art market is rooted firmly in the European tradition while to compound the difficulties few Latin American museums can boast any examples of European North American or even nonnational art at all Everything conspires to exacerbate the situation conventional art education teaches an arthistorical line of descent through the successive achievements of the Great Masters but such works are unavailable in Latin America except in the form of often poorquality reproductions In this sense things have not changed much since the seventeenth century Gironella always seems acutely aware of these issues For him the reworking of familiar images is not simply a matter of drawing attention to the way in which massreproduction numbs the optic nerves by shocking the spectator with a moustached Mona Lisa but rather using a peculiar blend of both iconoclasm and a sort of wry homage of investigating the power of certain images particularly those which have national resonance In this sense his Habsburg and Bourbon portraits are not dissimilar to Jasper Johns American flag series except of course that the flag whatever individuals may think of it is unquestionably American the lineage is clear The connecting threads between the Spanish  monarchy and colonial Mexico between Spanish artists and Mexican between past and present are tangled or broken Within Spanish art itself on the other hand the line is almost too simple Goya was intensely aware of Velázquez Picasso of both but for Gironella the problem is not just that Picasso could be seen to have inserted himself into the next place in the sequence but that as a Mexican an unequivocal position in any such arthistorical lineage is utterly unattainable Fig 1  Alberto GironellaLot y sus hijas Lot and his Daughters 19841987 retable 303 x 2415 x 30 cms collection of the artist Photograph Jorge Pablo de Aguinaco courtesy Galeria OMR Mexico Gironella was born in Mexico City in 1929 His rather was Catalan he had come to Mexico as a young man and worked in his brotherinlaws grocery shop He later set up his own business importing groceries from Europe particularly from Spain His mother was Yucatecan a mestiza from Mérida but she was ‘catalanised’ as Gironella put it by his father and grandmother in other words a jointly Eurocentric upbringing but perhaps significantly without personal contact with Europe until his first visit to Paris in 1960 He absorbed European culture through nineteenthcentury French novels and through the literature of sixteenth and seventeenthcentury Spain the Spanish cultural Golden Age His major literary enterprise as a student at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma in 1951 was the invention of a bad Golden Age poet whom he named Tiburcio Esquirla His later artistic inventions display the same fascination with the possibilities of getting inside the skin of another era Through his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars historians literary critics and art historians especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can ‘belong’ to the dynasty of European art is as it were to invade it retrospectively The decisive move from literature to painting came in 1952 Gironella seems to have been very confident about the change as in the same year he was instrumental together with Vlady and Héctor Xavier in establishing a new art gallery in Mexico City the Galeria Prisse This quickly emerged as one of the most avantgarde of the new Mexican galleries and the locus of a group of young artists including José Luis Cuevas who ‘with no fixed programme and no common plastic language…were united only by the desire for change’ Their discontent at this time was principally with the social realism of the muralist school but even at this early date there was unease with the propaganda emanating from the US that Abstract Expressionism was  the only possible alternative Gironellas solution was entirely individual to focus on the art of the European past looming large as it did in Latin American consciousness regardless of how often it had been declared dead and buried by Europeans Fig 2  Juan Bautista de MainoThe Recapture of Bahia  1635 oil on canvas Madrid Prado His artistic career began with a series of paintings based on the thirteenthcentury sculpture of the elegant countess of Uta on the façade of Naumburg cathedral a photograph of which had been lent to him by the young artist Vlady but in the late fifties he turned his attention to Spanish art His early choice of subject set the tone for his later work —— Goyas Queen Maria Luisa and Velázquezs portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano Fig 3— in other words great Spanish artists handling of their arrogant ugly bizarre or idiotic sitters He subjected both to repeated analysis ending up with a version of Maria Luisa in which she is transformed into a sharpbeaked staring owl and of Francisco Lezcano in which he has metamorphosed into a dog In both Gironella is exploring the characters of the sitters as suggested in their portraits rather than the formal painterly qualities Is Velázquezs Francisco Lezcano simpleminded or is his expression one of aloofness and distance Gironella has said he was drawn to this painting because Lezcano is holding some playing cards so his disconcertingly direct gaze is inviting us in to test our wits andor our luck against him Queen Maria Luisa wife of Charles IV an unlovely clever deceitful and immensely powerful woman is metamorphosed into a barnowl a lechuza  a word which in Spanish also means an ugly hag or a procuress Gironellas first direct encounter with Velázquez was at an exhibition of his work at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1959 Amongst the works on view was the one to which he has returned most often — the portrait of Queen Mariana of Austria second wife of Philip IV painted in 1652 Fig 4 This painting has become a veritable obsession and he has returned to it repeatedly over the past thirty years It is a fulllength portrait showing the young queen very formally dressed in a stiff conventional pose looking out at the spectator She wears a gigantic wig decorated with feathers and red bows the shape of which echoes that of the wide skirt One arm rests on the farthingale of the skirt the hand very delicately holding a large white scarf the other hand rests on a chair back In the earliest versions which date from 1959 — 60 Gironella turns her into a sort of rag doll perhaps never more than a welldressed shell she is now simply a collage of fragments of coarse torn cloth that appear to be pasted  down with thick smears of paint Fig 5 These early halflength versions like closeup details of the original also investigate compositional qualities the slight angle of the torso to the picture plane and the relationship of head and wig to shoulders as well as emphasising features which are to become increasingly fetishised in subsequent renderings — the massive wig for example And in the second version he introduces a threedimensional hand not as in the Velázquez with the fingers straight and limp but drawn up into an uneasy gesture that claws at her skirt rather than rests against it The hand and the wig are to become identifying features often used in isolation or in conjunction with elements from other pictures They become relics like the dismembered remains of Catholic saints that are boxed up and dispersed around Christendom to provide individual churches with the Churchs authority Fig 3  VeláquezFrancisco

Mariana has more substance than in the early collages of rags and so being more tangible is more a victim of Gironella of time of historical circumstances Fig 6 In this fulllength version Gironella places her square to the picture plane a crucial adjustment which changes the tone from that of the formality of the original into one of helplessness Moving from her external trappings to her internal structure he represents her as a sort of wooden skeleton At her breast instead of a gold rosette she wears a brass bell and a series of wheels and cogs apparently parts of an oldfashioned manually operated lift She is like a mechanical musical doll that will perform a ponderous dance when someone turns the dial She is also black In particular the uplifted unseeing face and the hand now even more tense and strained are modelled in three dimensions and painted shiny black She is of course a parody of her pale former Habsburg self but Gironellas titleLa Reina Negra  suggests a range of different resonances as indeed it does in English She is a piece in an international game of chess she is gloomy and melancholic she is also rather more strongly than in English unlucky wretched doomed But conversely in Latin Americanegra or neqrita are often used as terms of affection as if to ensure however that we cannot interpret this work as a declaration of Gironella s ideas about race and colour in Mexico there exists another version almost identical but for the fact that this is a white queen Fig 5  Alberto GironellaReina Mariana  1960 oil and collage on canvas 100 x 80 cms

year she is reincarnated but into wood not flesh and blood she becomes furniture a cross between a throne and a commode her masklike head and rigid hand fixed to the chair back her wig suggested by curly iron coat hooks and carved wooden scrolls and flourishes In one version the space beneath the seat contains a small stuffed cayman and as this is the equivalent of the space beneath her skirts there are obvious psychosexual overtones In another there is in fact no seat as such rather like a monks misericord a chair that is not a chair Fig 7 Again her heart is represented by the mechanism from an old lift she goes up and down as others will her The origins of Gironellas peculiar assemblages lie in his childhood His earliest memories are of stacks of colourful imported tins boxes bottles and packets of the family grocery business and of the paraphernalia of popular Catholicism which would have included reliquaries and tabernacles retables combining paintings and sculpture altars decorated with damask cloth candles flowers and ex votos of an often intensely personal nature He recalls building himself private altars of chocolate wrappers and tin cans The packaging of imported products has continued to fascinate him for intrinsic qualities —— the names the colours and the designs — but also no doubt because of the way products from far away have been integrated into the domestic Mexican environment Such products are known by the general term ultramarinos  ‘from across the ocean’ and to emphasise that Mariana herself is also an ultramarina  she is often accompanied in Gironellas tableaux by tins of sardines There are connections here too with Spanish Golden Age painting which as Gironella himself has observed often looks very smelly  The picaresque literature of the period is also very preoccupied with food and drink But it is not just the strong smells of food but the metaphorical smells of corruption and moral and social decay which are suggested by the inclusion of such items in his work And where the tins of fish are juxtaposed with fragments of Marianas body the evocation is also of death and putrefaction perhaps also of coarse jokes about the distinctive ‘fishy’ smell of vaginal secretions Gironellas choice of Veláquezs Mariana as the basis for so many of his works is worth considering in more detail First to develop the idea of the punning associations already referred to in relation to the term ultramarinos  there is the pleasing assonance between the name of this earthly Queen Mariana and that of Maria Queen of Heaven The Virgin has always been more popular than Christ in the New World indeed in the sixteenth century certain churchmen had argued that while the East was the domain of Christ the newly discovered West was that of his mother Once in America however Maria soon fragments into numerous different Marias each with her own distinctive attributes In Mexico during the Wars of Independence the Virgin of Guadalupe protected the nationalist forces while the Spaniards placed their trust in the Virgen de los Remedios Gironellas many versions of Velázquezs Mariana similarly fragment her into different roles — queen woman icon cadaver carnival figure victim aggressor There is a third sister in this euphonious family Marina the baptised name of Malinche mistress of Cortèz through whose good offices and linguistic skills Mexico was conquered both for the Virgin Maria and for Marinas royal ancestors Marina is the original and ultimate traitor to her people but as mother of the first mestizo she is also the mother of modern Mexico Mariana herself is remembered more as a name on a family tree than as a person Wife of Philip IV she was also his niece she had been betrothed to his son Baltasar Carlos but on his death at seventeen the King her uncle married her himself and the only surviving son of this union was the cretinous Charles II last of the Habsburg line She is also remembered because she was painted by Velázquez although this is not unrelated to the family tree Velázquez shaped the public image of this family for his own and for all subsequent generations investing them with an extraordinary pictorial power and stability His portraits must in turn be considered an important constituent in their power as compensation for their more corporeal weaknesses With hindsight it perhaps seems strange that one of the indisputably greatest figures in the whole of Western art devoted the better part of his life to selladvancement and to painting the King his family and their attendant dogs dwarves and sycophants Certainly the irony of this together with the fact that this inbred family of often considerable mental as well as physical fragility should have controlled the destiny of so vast an empire is not lost on Gironella fig 7  Alberto GironellaReina Mariana  1962 object Private collection We can read into Las Meninas such a view of the Habsburgs Fig 8 Philip IV and Mariana are merely reflections living in a world of grotesquerie and makebelieve a tiny princess dressed as an adult with a skirt so stiff it makes her look as if she is on wheels surrounded by curtseying maids a dwarf a midget a huge dog with the ability to sleep through anything and a great artist aloof and allpowerful Such a view is of course anachronistic but this is exactly the attraction of Gironellas reworkings — he can present us with shifting visions of the art of the past from within and from without exploiting contrary responses period eye and innocent eye Not surprisingly Gironella has returned over and again to aspects of Las Meninas and in particular to the portrait of the artist himself the insider the fawning courtier the creator of icons Festin in Palacio is one of Gironellas latterday altarpieces and a digest of elements from three paintings —Queen Mariana Las Meninas and the portrait of the dwarf Francisco Lezcano popularly known as El Niño de Vallecas Fig 9 In the lower register on the altar frontal the tilted head of Lezcano leers at us while boxed up alongside a disembodied head and a hand are presented as relics of Queen Mariana while above Velázquez himself palette in hand seems to fade into a dog On the altar table itself in front of a piece of red damask lies a large realisticallymodelled dog This is the dog from the foreground of Las Meninas  but here awake and ready for action the centre of attraction and apparently the object of devotion The implications of Festin in Palacio are realised in a particularly horrific version of Queen Mariana of 1963Perro devorando a la Reina Mariana Dog devouring Queen Mariana where she is set upon by hunting dogs who tear at her bloodred head gear Fig 10 During the

which go to make up modern Mexico The Queen of Yokes is a good example in its complexity and range of reference Fig 11 Here again Mariana is pinned out flat composed of disparate elements Her wig is

 the colonial yoke and the yokes of marriage and of the church and all of these are implied here Mariana is yoked in an arranged marriage to her uncle Philip IV she as representative of the Spanish crown is also a representative of the colonial and religious yokes which bound Mexico to Spain The motif of the yoke was originally the emblem of Isabella of Castile Marianas distant predecessor who

combined emblems of Isabellas yoke Y for Ysabella and her husband Ferdinands arrows Flechas  were expropriated by the Falangists in an attempt to claim some historical legitimacy In other words verbally and visually the emblem of the yoke has strong resonances in Spain and Mexico But it is important that here the yokes are inverted Mariana and the ties with Spain she represents have been transformed translated into Mexican into the  complexities of the mestizo Mexican present She is an essential but individually helpless cog in the colonial machine she is pinned out like a precolumbian sacrificial victim bruised and bloodstained she is a religious icon like a popular image of the Virgin Maria she is a mannikin from some popular religious festival Fig 10  Alberto

the art of the Spanish past and that of Picasso Picassos extensive series of variations on Las Meninas was produced in 1957 but even if Gironella knew of them when he himself began to work on versions of Velázquez which is highly unlikely as Picassos paintings were not exhibited until 1959 even though their interest in the art of the past at that point in their careers was for both perhaps a rejection of abstraction and even though both can in some way be defined as exiled from their Spanish roots as outsiders looking in —— yet the results are widely divergent Picassos paintings are principally explorations of or developments of matters internal to Las Meninasthe light the perspective the angle of Marianas head the bobbing handmaids echoed for example in the paintings of pigeons bobbing on his window sill and so on  In one version for example the odd position of Nicolas Pertusatos hands is rationalised by the addition of a piano Gironella is far removed from such light humour Edouard Jaguer when comparing the two rather acidly remarks that ‘despite all the irritating virtuosity’ of Picassos rendering of Delacroix or Manet or Velázquez in the end they are onedimensional Gironella is of course also interested in the formal qualities of these works but it is the subject matter the content which really holds his imagination Drawn to the factisstrangerthanfiction aspects of Spanish history Gironella found in Veláquezs portraits a perfect starting point for a detailed investigation of the contradictions which go to make up modern Mexico His preoccupations are unusual if not unique as he claims but they are unquestionably engendered by the search for a cultural identity which lies behind so much of Latin Americas greatest artistic and literary creations Ambivalence towards European culture doubts about the possibilities of finding an authentic voice a restless search for confidence and selfesteem these are among the many bitter fruits of colonial rule in Latin America In 1921 Siqueiros had urged artists to ‘avoid those lamentable archaeological reconstructions’‘Indianism’ ‘Primitivism’ ‘Americanism but he had also warned against the use of ‘archaic motifs’ from the old masters of European art ‘which for us would be exotic’ instead his advice was to study the arts of both learning from the ‘constructive base’ the ‘great sincerity’ of the latter and the ‘synthetic energy’of the former to combine the ‘lost values’of the past with new values to produce an art appropriate to modern America It may not be quite what Siqueiros envisaged but Gironellas is an authentically Mexican solution Fig 12  Arrows and yoke emblem of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic Kings from Casa de Las Conchas Salamanca 1483 Previous Convictions Paul Wood Against

mixedin with its rewards and knowledge a depressing effect Does it matter Callinicos own apology about publishing yet another study of an overworked subject notwithstanding it remains an important contemporary debate It isnt that the more so since Callinicos contribution contains a significantly original dimension Despite its fashionable subject the book is in no sense routine Uncritical testimonials to the postmoderns attractions are ten a penny and conservative denunciations thereof not much scarcer This study has the distinction of being both critical and radical essentially turning the tables on advocates of the postmodern and reading their rhetoric as symptomatic of a conservative milieus interests in a period of overall stagnation It is ‘of course’ unlikely that Callinicos criticism will cut much ice with those whose substantial career investments lie in one or another of the postmoderns corners movementist politics the radical academy post thisism and thatism a variety of wellupholstered ‘dissenting’niches from both the dominant culture and traditional opposition to it Too much is at stake for a book dedicated to proving the continuing value of classical Marxism to dislodge them Maybe this is one reason for depression then that the books wellwrought arguments will not exercise those whose ideology it dissects This indeed has already happened Callinicos Marxism has been repelled from the ramparts of pluralism for being…well Marxist It leads to the Gulag you know and is patriarchal to boottranslation Marx had a beard Given that Callinicos book is difficult and given the probability that despite the seriousness of its argument it is unlikely to be widely debated I will firstly offer an interpretation of what I think its main themes are and what they are not In the first place as the title makes plain if offers a searching criticism of the claim that we are living in a postmodern epoch and the consequence of that claim that the culture and politics appropriate to such an epoch are structurally different from those of the preceding — and now past — Modern one Callinicos criticism of the ‘postmodern’ hypothesis contains a range of emphases the three principal ones of which are First advocates of the postmodern in art which attains uncommon prominence in so far as the ‘postmodern’is powerfully underwritten by a claimed distinction from Modernism tend to misread the modern and arrogate its defining characteristics to their own period The main ones of these are the ordering concept of ‘doubling’—— double coding the laying of one text over or against another the relationship to historical codes of representation and the relationship to popular codes of representation Callinicos is able to set the claims of such postmodern advocates as Charles Jencks and Linda Hutcheon against an analysis of Modernism predicated largely on that of Eugene Lunn in order to demonstrate that the latter is a good deal more complex in respect of its characteristic conceptions of the subject expression reflexion etc than the former are wont to have it This is so to the extent that the claim for a structurally distinct postmodernist mode of signification breaks down in the face of a variety of historical avantgarde practices ranging across Europe from London to Vienna and Moscow in the hands of such as Eliot Joyce the Cubists Surrealists and others including somewhat surprisingly Kokoschka A further set of more qualified — or at least less wholesale — more ambiguous claims are then encountered by authors such as Lyotard Jameson and Lash These include the postmodern as a tendency within the modern a notion of the ‘sublime’ and postmodernisms related freedom from dependence on the concept of totality a distinction between the postmodern conceived in terms of the externalised and impersonal as against a view of the modern as characterised by the internal and ‘impressionist’ and a claim that it is the characteristic of the postmodern to signify figurally rather than discursively  Callinicos conclusion to these arguments is that despite their efforts built around a claimed contrast of the postmodern either with or within Modernism these authors have produced only ‘mutually and often internally inconsistent accounts’ of the ‘postmodern’ manifesting an ‘inability to come up with a plausible and coherent account of its distinguishing characteristics’p 28 It is in fact Callinicos later claim that rather than occupying a qualitatively distinct position ‘late capitalist culture represents a continuation of trends operative throughout this century’p 53 The second main emphasis of Callinicos critique is aimed at the philosophy most frequently regarded as underpinning claims for the distinction of a postmodern culture viz poststructuralism Drawing on  his own previous work as well as that of Dews and Habermas the main thrust is initially to connect both ‘wings’ of poststructuralism — the ‘textualist’strand associated with Derrida and the ‘contextualisthistorical strand identified principally with Foucault — to the Nietzschean philosophical tradition and then to isolate the most common problems attributed to that tradition to whicha fortiori  poststructuralism succumbs These concern the subject the issue of how critical resistance to dominant codes ever develops in the absence of an adequate conception of the subject and perhaps most fundamentally the traditional problem facing any philosophy seeking to reduce knowledge to interests tout court  of using rational argument to prove the limits on rationality This is the densest yet at the same time one of the most persuasive sections of the book wherein a variety of arguments drawn from the analytic tradition are deployed against Nietzsches lineage Quine and Davidson on a theory of meaning both holistic and realist — demonstrating that there are more ways out of atomism and the myths of the given than Saussures and an antirelativist notion of truth as a ‘regulative ideal’ derived from Tarski Popper and Lakatos There is no space here central though it is to Callinicos argument as a whole to do other than note how this perspective is then deployed not only to counter poststructuralism but also significantly to modify the position of its main critic Habermas If Foucault and Derrida are taken to task for their Nietzschean lineage Habermas main weakness is deemed to lie in his Kantianism manifest in a formalist ‘metaethics’ and his conception of ‘communicative rationality’ grounded in the consensual account of meaning offered by speechact theory — and as such likewise vulnerable to Davidson as well as to Wittgenstein In essence then at this philosophical level Callinicos is marrying historical materialism and analytical philosophy as it were Marx and Wittgenstein in order to defeat a range of new and old Idealisms principally that tradition dismissive of Enlightenment rationalism descending from Nietzsche via Heidegger to a bathetic end in Lyotard and Baudrillard Compelling as it is however this strategy does not form the conclusion of Callinicos case The third main emphasis in his critique of the concept of the postmodern is to attempt to explain the hold exercised by a demonstrably deficient theory of culture and its dependence on a fundamentally irrationalist philosophy which is to say he offers a politics of the postmodern There are two pillars to this account the emergence in the postwar period and more particularly in the last two decades of a mass social layer analysable under the rubric of a new middle class — though internally much differentiated as well as distinct from a traditional petite bourgeoisie in respect of its structured ‘overconsumptionism’ And secondly the defeat of the last major challenge to the system associated with the overdetermined name of ‘1968’ but finally petering out in the mid1970s The latter is primary the emergence or at least acceleration of the former a consequence of measures adopted by newly confident conservative states to cope with the reentry of the world system into a succession of capitalist crises after the exhaustion of the Long Boom This kind of argument reads well in Callinicos hands but it is worth reminding ourselves of the unattractive reality to which it bears witness A real tragedy has taken place If one only takes educational institutions such as universities and colleges let alone the world outside the emancipatory impulse of the sixties and early seventies has been turned inside out What began as a compelling rejection of a straitjacketing orthodoxy made its criticism in terms of a materialist demand that the sociopolitical locale of culture be addressed in the face of an institutionalised aversion to any such examination conducted under a selfserving misrepresentation of the autonomy of art This stance has now been inverted by a puritanical moralising clerisy which virtually polices conduct and enquiry in the name of a postmodern triptych — as Terry Eagleton has put it — of class and race and gender What amounts to a fear of art perpetrated under a false rhetoric of care and defence of the marginalised now dominates everything this oxymoronic ‘radical orthodoxy’ touches And it touches a lot Making all due allowance for the return of historical tragedy as farce watching this soporific monolith of the virtuous rise out of the debris of a liberating movement is akin to nothing so much as witnessing Bureaucracy emerge from the ashes of Revolution It is one of Callinicos main concerns to relate the constellation of ideas and cultural practices trading under a conception of the postmodern condition to an inadequate and escapist politics the claim as one of his own critics has had it that ‘the conditions that sustain oppression can be altered piecemeal’Patton cited p 85 Callinicos mordantly comments on the descent ‘from revolutionary groupuscule to singleissue campaigns and then to social democracy’ In sum then while acknowledging the stature of some elements of this constellation such as the historical aspects of Foucaults work or the critical élan of Fredric Jameson not to mention the giant figure of Habermas Callinicos develops a root and branch assault on claims for the cultural distinction of the ‘postmodern’ for the conceptual adequacy of its theoretical base and above all for the deleterious political consequences of adherence to it So far so good or one might almost say so unproblematic Callinicos mobilises as powerful a body of argument and evidence as is readily conceivable against a variety of contemporary critics and theorists whose claims he sees with justice as a trahison des clercs  Thus far there is something almost conventional about the books stance It is possible — just — to imagine a relatively orthodox artist critic or historian appreciating the demolition of postmodernism if not the evidence of late capitalisms corruption and decay But this is not the arguments main thrust and it is this rather elusive second aspect which gives the book its definitive character ‘Elusive’ isnt quite the word however It is more a matter of approaching the books arguments from within a milieu of relatively academic contemporary art theory and being unable to see the wood for the trees For the concomitant of Callinicos critique of postmodernism is not as it would be in half a hundred other cases the defence of modernism For one thing Callinicos goes out of his way to establish that the intellectual tradition he is concerned to critique is itself most fruitfully read not as an articulation of a qualitatively new postmodernism but an instance of a Modernisttype response Thus ‘poststructuralism … the philosophical expression of Modernism whose characteristic themes were indeed announced by Nietzsche’p 6 Nietzsches ‘system of ideas’ is ‘in many respects a philosophical articulation of the main themes of Modernism’p 67 Callinicos is concerned to give weight to the proposition advanced by Franco Moretti in respect of Carl Schmitt that it is not the task of Marxism to defend Modernism as if its devices were ‘inherently subversive of the existing social order’p 48 The point is that for Callinicos Nietzschean thought is an instance of Romantic anticapitalism that form of refusal of the implications of capitalist modernity which has been present virtually since the birth of that condition described by Michael Lowy as ‘opposition to capitalism in the name of precapitalist values’cited p 67 The consequence of this is that Modernism too must be a form of romantic anticapitalism and as such onesided and vulnerable The principal weakness of both the modernist tradition proper and indeed of Nietzsche himself is for Callinicos their aestheticism It is as well to be clear on this Callinicos defence of classical Marxism of historical materialism is in the first instance deployed against a postmodernism which has come to proclaim the death of the grand narrative of emancipation and the need for a new form of politics not constructed along the lines of the traditional left This defence of Marxism carries over however to a critique of Modernism itself not merely for the fact that Nietzsche attaches ‘importance’ to art but for the further claim ascribed to him and therefore to Modernism itself that ‘the nature of aesthetic experience contains in nuce the form of understanding proper to the world itself p 66 In the end that is Callinicos pits historical materialism against not merely postmodernism but following the logic that the latter is indistinguishable from Modernism properly conceived against Modernism itself Drawing largely on the Marshall BermanPerry Anderson debate and thereby making of Modernism the characteristic expression of the experience of modernity itself conceived as a response to capitalist modernisation Callinicos seems to want to claim in essence that both the former are partial in respect of the fact of this last Webers conceptualisation of the modern as a process of structural differentiation is I think seen to be echoed in Modernist claims for the specificity of art Both are then held to be deficient relative to Marxs conception of a ‘mode of production’within which differentiation can be understood made intelligible and ultimately accountable to a materialistically grounded ethics of emancipation rooted in a conception of a ‘complex’ totality It is in connection with this perspective that Callinicos was concerned to deny the common conflation by postmodernists of Modernism with the Enlightenment From his point of view Modernism as a subspecies of romantic anticapitalism is one partial moment in the rejection of the consequences of Enlightenment properly understood understood that is in terms of a Marxism which is itself held out as the genuine heir to the Enlightenment narrative of emancipation and its romantic critique Here lies the root of Callinicos project — the buttressing of Marxism as the ‘true radicalisation’ of the Enlightenment and here I suspect lies also his ultimate discomfort with Modernism — prone as it is to slip the leash of a guiding politics and dance under the less biddable star of the Aesthetic At this point Callinicos has to be careful it is one thing to dismiss the claims of a rootless postmodernism wandering naked except for its designer trainers across the face of a barren late capitalism It is quite another also to offer a wholesale refutation of Modernism And Callinicos is aware of this ‘Is not the general tendency of this analysis similar to Lukács celebrated denunciation of Modernism as ‘aesthetically appealing but decadent’p 53 For fairly obvious reasons mostly no doubt connected with the spectre of Zhdanov and Socialist Realism but also I suspect because of a more subterranean philosophical linkage between Callinicos endorsement of Althussers ‘complex totality’ against Lukács ‘expressive totality’and the political voluntarism which it informed in the early twenties Callinicos has to answer No This begins to be interesting and it is I think the originary focus of that sense of misgiving with which I began If I have been primarily expository hitherto and I have been because I believe Callinicos book to be the best on this subject that we have I will now begin to turn to criticism or at least to trying to ventilate that reservation which faced by Callinicos certainty will not be stilled In a sense it doesnt matter if Callinicos defence of Marxism is registered or not by the legion of Postisms and ists which form the undergrowth of contemporary cultural politics They will wither at the first frosts anyway if they come and if they dont… But with his placement of Modernism in the lineage of Nietzsche and as such at odds with Marx  and Freud as the real motors of that ‘true radicalisation of the Enlightenment’p 120 which is the only way ahead something more serious is at stake To backtrack a little the case is perhaps not so monolithic as I have implied for which we have to return to the detail of Callinicos ‘No’ to Lukács On the one hand — and this is a point to which I shall return — there is a dual claim against Lukács evolutionism to the effect that different levels of a social formation are relatively autonomous crudely if bourgeois society is decadent this does not necessarily mean as Lukács thought it did that its art is too and in favour of the possibility of being able to pass a positive ‘aesthetic judgement’ upon a particular work however questionable the general category under which it has been produced a position related to Brechts polemic against Lukács More empirically however on the other hand and drawing upon the work of Peter Bürger Callinicos accepts the case for Modernism having contained a critical moment — a ‘protest against the capitalist society to which it is in complex ways related’p 53 This is principally indexed to the claimed historical transformation of Modernism into a series of engaged avantgardes dedicated not to the aestheticisation of life but to the integration of art into life As Bürger has it ‘Aestheticism had made the distance from the praxis of life the content of works The business of the new configuration was different art ‘transferred to the praxis of life’— not however ‘to integrate art into this praxis’ but ‘the attempt to organise a new life praxis from a basis in art’cited p 54 The ‘avantgarde’ here means of course constructivism surrealism and a range of Weimar practices grouped by Callinicos somewhat misleadingly under the label ‘Neue Sachlichkeit’ Just how remote this stance in fact is from the aesthetic is a matter for further debate but it is perhaps worth interpolating that the implied valorisation of the products of these engaged avantgardes as a function of their engagement is defeasible Contra Buchloh et al  as well as Callinicos there is nothing as far as art as distinct from culture or politics is concerned which will a priori privilege a Tatlin made in revolutionary Petrograd from a Matisse painted in a hotel bedroom on the Riviera — Benjamin on technique notwithstanding dont forget Benjamin owned a Klee Be that as it may these avantgardes are held to have a ‘distinctive character’ which resides in their ‘seeking to abolish the separation between art and life’ For Callinicos this is ‘unquestionable’ as is the fact that the shift is enabled by the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 These arguments owe much to Perry Andersons location of the tripartite enabling conditions of the Modern movement as a decrepit academicism the presence of new technologies and ‘the imaginative proximity of social revolution’ For Callinicos it is October which made the vision of social transformation ‘concrete’ The downside of this so to speak is that the defeat of Octobers aspirations also marks the avantgardes defeat ‘Between them Stalinism and Nazism destroyed the avant garde The political defeats of the 1930s ‘shipwreck’ the avantgarde and furthermore through a kind of extension since one assumes Andersons tripartite conjuncture fuelled even those Modernist forms which did not quite take the transformatory step into engaged avantgardism come to determine ‘the more general exhaustion of Modernism’ The end of the Second World War is marked by the incipient commodification of social life and as such ‘the disintegration of the Modernist conjuncture’pp 60 — 1 The problem then begins to stand clear and I shall now have to be brief and schematic Callinicos drives a coach and horses through postmodernism well and good But the roads on which he drives it also go through most of the art produced in the last half century — shall we say for the sake of convenience since the death of Trotsky or in a more apt frame of reference since Guernica  I will simply have to state the case dogmatically but this is untenable All of Callinicos philosophical sophistication and matchless political experience evaporate in the face of the art of his own lifetime Aside from the fact that he doesnt actually discuss it in any detail there is little more than a disappointed huffing and puffing at the exhaustion of the avantgardes shock value backed up by a particularly crass quotation from Peter Bürger about Duchamps readymades and some utterly routine panting over the outlandish prices being currently paid for Van Goghs — plus a quotation from a subWarholian Manhattan ‘artist’ answering an art magazine questionnaire with a few smart remarks about business and producing art for the market as if this were adequate to underwrite a claim for the avantgardes loss of critical virtue In an extraordinary passage towards the end of the book amplified in discussion at Marxism 90 in a debate specifically convened to discuss Modernism and Postmodernism Callinicos described his experience of walking around an art gallery ‘I have often been struck by the tedium that overcomes one while walking through a gallery of twentiethcentury painting arranged in chronological order as one moves from the excitement of the early part of the century to the desperate and all too frequently sterile iconoclasm of recent artists p 161 The specifics arent clear but the contextual indications are that this would include American art from say Pollock to André not to mention a range of contemporary work on commodification stemming from Warhol All of which says more about Callinicos and the limits on his knowledge and interests than it does about the work Whither Brecht now on the lure of the good old days not to mention the nostalgia laid at the door of romantic anticapitalism I shall conclude briefly The point is I think that the argument from here can go two ways The first response is that it doesnt matter very much Callinicos defence of Marxism is erudite and compelling and the fact that he runs out of steam over postwar art is of less moment than the fact that he takes the range of issues seriously enough to discuss them at all Most sociologists economists and politicians after all dont get that far The second road is however rockier and it is an undecided question whether its implications are depressing and frightening or challenging and exhilarating Callinicos is very careful to say in at least two places in the book that aesthetic judgement as to the value of a work of art is at least relatively independent of the cultural and philosophical critique of the bases from which it proceeds Thus in his discussion of Modernism relative to Lukács and Brecht ‘to highlight the fact that Modernism shares with Romanticism a ‘subjectified occasionalism is not thereby to pass a negative aesthetic judgement on the works of art grouped together under the former label Brechts polemic ie against Lukács…retains all its force today’p 53 And again á propos Postmodernism ‘Nor does the argument set out in this section imply the dismissal of all recent works — including those described as ‘Postmodern’—— as worthless rubbish Good art can be produced in an immense variety of different conditions’p 161 This magnanimity is precisely the problem The traffic is all one way Callinicos appears to think that he can detect ‘aesthetic merit’ from the position given to him by his politics politics writ large as embodying an ethics and a philosophy is the active force Thus postSecond World War art is as it is —— with an ‘emphasis on the autonomous and abstract work of art’p 154— allegedly because of the ‘effects’ of the stabilisation and extension of capitalism Cause and effect what took place was a ‘flight into abstraction’ This is a language a world view a form of life perhaps wherein one of the principal reasons for according praise to a type of art is that it is able to give voice to a politics Bolshevism in the main case though as Callinicos acknowledges one of the salient points about Modernism was its ‘ambiguity its capacity to express a variety of different political positions’ that is when it was not engaged on its more usual ‘flight from politics’p 161 Art it seems is the perpetual recidivist always ducking back into the aesthetic as soon as vigilant life averts its gaze When times are bad and reactionary commodification sets in the deleterious upshot is ‘the recuperation of the avantgarde for art’p 157 When things are on the up and the lodestar of a transformatory politics shines bright so too does ‘the avantgarde project of overcoming the separation of art and life’p 171 In this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art The individual ‘good’ work might get thrown up however unpropitious the circumstance But it can only be a quirk and the force of its ‘goodness’ is strictly limited and circumscribed Only once in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology But even this is done in the name of a supposed ‘immediate sensuous charge’ rather than any more extended critical capacity of art or the aesthetic Of course the whole thrust of the historic avantgarde and particularly its celebration here lies in its being associated with a liberation from bourgeois ideology but this is not quite the same as having your revolutionary commitments tested by your aesthetic judgement For by far the greater part the aesthetic is bracketed in the name of a robust historical materialism And there is no room for doubt as to which is the tail and which the dog Walter Benjamin once implied something rather different Speaking against social realism in ‘The Author as Producer’ he identifies a works ‘political tendency’ and its ‘literary tendency’ The relationship he postulates is not oneway traffic it is dialectical A work ‘can only be politically correct if it is also literarily correct’ I take this to mean that there is an equality a reciprocity between the aesthetic and the political such that an aesthetic dimension or response can give the lie to a political claim The point of Benjamins article seems to be to decentre the political or at least to subject it to test to remove those making claims for their political correctness from their habitual position of judge and jury such that the art can in principle sort out the politics and not just vice versa It is this in the end which I find disquieting about Callinicos book Not the vapidity of the postmodern which it reveals But the way in which the very limits of its historical materialism which I take to be the most developed statement of the case available in English put back on the agenda questions one had considered closed The critique of Nietzsches apocalyptic aestheticism with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius just cannot be reduced to the cliché about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate At least you would have to be a doctor to say so and not a politician or an academic A requirement to minimise even to trivialise the aesthetic — one might almost say a fear of the aesthetic — is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here There is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic But a tame aesthetic is no friend of historical materialism Art has to be more than an ornament or a reinforcement There has to be the possibility that the politics can be put at risk by the aesthetics or the relationship as well as each of its components will be inert An unpredictable aesthetic it could be said is a requirement of an historical materialism adequate to its political task If the aesthetic is genuinely to  have reciprocal leverage upon the political certain problems have to be faced For example what goes on when looking at say a Matisse in an art gallery It is easy to say that the time spent considering the Matisse is time better spent than that spent considering a Gerasimov let alone a Bouguereau It is a terminal problem with the race nclass ngender triptych that all these transactions are equivalently sociological But what of time spent otherwise How to adjudicate The problem of course goes inescapably to a notion of the quality of experience though what we are calling the aesthetic here is not or not only a question of intensity The relationship between say reading an article in Socialist Review on the bureaucracys pursuit of revenge on Arthur Scargill and what it is that can be got from staring at Rembrandts nose in a late selfportrait just is open One is not a priori more important than the other Which is also to say that it is not the case that there is no connection or that a category mistake is involved in the mere comparison The information about Arthur should bear upon how one regards the Rembrandt But the way Rembrandts nose is worked should equally provide a corrective to rhetoric or elision in the writing on bureaucracy Which is to say the political commentary is a form of writing Or to use an unfashionable term in these linguistic days of thought And it is of the utmost importance to realise that the pragmatic answer to these questions is itself what makes the revolution never happen Which latter is not however to say that ‘correct thinking’ overturns society Thought and organisation or aesthetics and politics must circle each other warily the one never letting the other out of its sight The abyss which all this opens up is perhaps terrifying before it is ‘depressing’ I have mentioned Walter Benjamin here Callinicos concludes his book by invoking the memory of Benjamin to the effect that socialist revolution in the form of an irruption into history is the secular vehicle of a redemption hitherto conceivable only in mystic terms For Callinicos it is a belief in this possibility and that alone which remainders melancholy and irony — that is to say Modernism — as an adequate response to modern life It is the consequence — presumably unintended — of his argument however that it demonstrates so irrevocably how much this is a matter of commitment and as such beyond the reach of proof One could say that the pressing question is how it is possible to live rather than what teleology to adopt or at least that the latter does not sort the former out Benjamin remarked tellingly that it is less a question of what a mans beliefs are than the kind of man those beliefs make of him This is no less an aesthetic matter than a political one Callinicos in his haste to counter aestheticism reduces the aesthetic He has to Yet the aesthetic will not be reduced It is not the means to an end conceived elsewhere but an ‘as if ’ no less substantial than the as if of revolution itself Value you say Pushkin eating cherries before a duel Lenin working day in day out on Iskra one sentence or a newspaper the point is of course not one without the other Benjamin on the requirement to denature your work ‘like ethyl alcohol’ lest it be of use to the other side For revolutions may occur but the belief that they will does not of itself ensure a better lived life As to truth and beauty — the truth can doubtless be beautiful though it need not be Certain kinds of oneway traffic certain kinds of oneway street are in the end not hard to negotiate Their avoidance may be more difficult by far And there is always the possibility — the necessity— that beauty can be its own truth Like taking poison on the border THE ART OF SCIENCE GEOFFREY CANTOR The Science of Art Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat Martin Kemp Yale University Press New Haven and London 1990 pp viii — 375 554 black and white illustrations — 16 colour plates ISBN 0 — 300 — 04337 — 6 £49 In a heady essay written over thirty years ago Giorgio de Santillana argued that some of the key ideas of the Scientific Renaissance were to be traced to developments in the arts In particular the idea of space was transformed from the Aristotelian conception — a ‘tidy arrangement of a simple multiplicity of things not unlike let us say the shipping department of SearsRoebuck— into ‘a matrix for infinite potential complexities and states and tensions’ The main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists especially Alberti Brunelleschi and Leonardo who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space When I first encountered de Santillanas paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive Its attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science They had argued that the new ideas about space and motion had arisen from an intellectual and to a much lesser extent empirical critique of the preceding largely Anstotelian notions Discussion of this transformation was confined to the great tradition of philosopherscientists beginning with Aristotle continuing with medieval authors such as Oresme and Jordanus and ending with Kepler Galileo Descartes and of course Newton De Santillana offered a very different account of the new ideas of space and a different cast of actors Most importantly he claimed that the new science was not the progeny of earlier science but the outgrowth of developments in the practical arts In his account the history of art and the history of science were intrinsically linked in the late 1960s this was an heretical claim to most historians of science and probably many historians of art Although sympathetic to this heresy I found myself intoxicated but also somewhat inhibited by de Santillanas impressionistic style However exciting his paper his thesis seemed in danger of crumbling if it were reworked into a conventional historical discourse In the book under review Martin Kemp reexamines the artscience relationship with much care and circumspection His style is lucid and he emerges as an honest broker who judiciously weighs the historical evidence He has an impressive command of the literature of both art and optical science across much of Europe and over a span of four centuries In contrast to de Santillanas uninterrupted thirty pages of text Kemps thesis is amply illustrated with several hundred plates including many of his own line drawings showing artists deployment of visual angles vanishing points etc The reader is led gently through the history of art and the details of optical science to appreciate their interrelationship Albeit less impressionistic and insightful Kemps analysis is of broader scope and greater clarity than de Santillanas Kemp identifies optics as a topic of common concern to both art and science In a sequel he proposes to pursue the role of anatomy and natural history in the history of art Of the many interweaving strands within this extensive topic he concentrates primarily on the way artists have deployed scientific ideas and instruments — these connections constitute ‘the science of art’ of his title —— while he also encompasses a number of related themes The science of art claims Kemp has not been adequately appreciated by art historians and to begin to rectify the situation he strives to demonstrate that ‘there were special kinds of affinity between the central intellectual and observational concerns in the visual arts and the sciences in European history between the Renaissance and the nineteenth century p 1 In the first of the books three sections Kemp examines the theory and practice of perspective from Brunelleschi to Turner The second section which is less focused and less easy to characterise contains discussion of perspective machines and other technical aids as well as theories of perception The final section is concerned with the theory and depiction of colour In the first section one of Kemps main themes is the relationship between theoria and praxis Renaissance artists confronting the problem of portraying spatial arrangement responded by developing linear perspective The initial emphasis was on praxis Following the first crude attempts by Giotto Lorenzetti and others Brunelleschi got it right Then in the mid1430s Alberti the theorist codified the system The basic rules of linear perspective were now accessible to any artist Theoria could influence praxis The relation between the theory and practice of  perspective over the next four centuries is examined in detail Textbooks flourished making the rules of perspective available to aspiring artists Codifiers produced ever more elaborate schemes for the depiction of spatial arrangements often thereby rendering their work incomprehensible to the practising artist Artists architects and draughtsmen experimented with the new schemes since the theory of perspective offered exciting possibilities to depict the spatial relations between bodies Thus the eye could be subjected to precise ‘reality’ or it could be repositioned led titillated or deceived Some of the most fascinating material in this book is provided by the uses of perspective to create illusions — such as Mantegnas Camera degli Sposi 1465 — 74 and Pozzos dome of San Ignazio 1685 Moreover Kemp hints at the diverse uses of perspective which offer a rich commentary on European history In the third and final section of the book Kemp addresses the use and theory of colours He argues that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries many artists adopted versions of the Aristotelian theory which asserted that colours are a mixture of black and white in different proportions They also often used constructively the analogy between colours and the harmonic scale However Newtons theory of light and colours first published in 1672 and extended in his Opticks 1704 provided a new direction for colour theorists In opposition to Aristotle et al  Newton showed with his prism that white light is a mixture of its composite colours Moreover in the Opticks he identified seven colours in the spectrum and described a circle divided into seven segments that could be used to account for colour mixing Newtons views were subsequently both elaborated and criticised Colour circles became ever more elaborate and orientated towards the practice of colourmixing — witness those of Moses Harris c 1770 and MichelLugène Chevreul 1839 Louis Castel exploited the analogy between light and sound with his ‘Ocular clavichord’ and Goethe explored subjective colours For their part artists were experimenting and drawing on the insights provided by the colour theorists Delacroix took Chevreul seriously Turner always alive to new ideas responded creatively to both Harris and Goethe Seurat paid close attention to both Helmholtzs Handbook of Physiological Optics 1867 and Ogden Roods Modern Chromatics 1879 which in turn was based on James Clerk Maxwells threecolour theory of vision Such a brief summary does not do justice to the detail and complexity of Kemps argument Optics provides a superb locus for examining the artscience relationship since optical problems theories and constructions were integral to both science and art To admit that much is not to foreclose the question of defining that relationship since a nuanced understanding requires the command of historical detail that Kemp provides Viewed from the late twentieth century and the widespread acceptance of the ‘two cultures’ the search for affinities between art and science possesses particular significance for the historian Yet by viewing history in this manner Kemp encounters an historiographical difficulty that he never satisfactorily resolves This problem surfaces even in his introduction in which he states that his concern is to show how artists ‘consciously aspired towards goals that we would now regard as scientific in a broad sense’p 1 Part of this passage has been italicised to draw attention to the somewhat presentist presupposition that underpins much of this book In qualifying ‘scientific’ by ‘in a broad sense’Kemp shows that he is aware of this problem However the presentist influence is all too pervasive His frequent appeals to ‘scientific concepts’ and ‘scientific ideas’often presuppose an unambiguous definition of science and one that is atemporal The difficulty is most apparent when discussing the Renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities Kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors Take the example of Brunelleschi who according to Kemp introduced ‘scientific consistency’ into his use of perspective p 14 The phrase suggests that Brunelleschi was engaging in an activity other than art Was he doing science And if so would he and his contemporaries have recognised that in pursuing this consistency he was doing science not art Again how were science and art demarcated in the early fifteenth century —— socially intellectually and institutionally Kemps difficulty in defining ‘science’ and ‘art’is not confined to his discussion of the earlier period For example in his appraisal of the eighteenth century he uses ‘scientific’ and ‘Newtonian’as predicates to create the impression of an hypostasised activity which stood separate from art and other aspects of Western culture including philosophy Thus we are told that Brook Taylor the author of the first major British work on perspective 1715 was ‘a professional Newtonian scientist’p 287 Although Taylor was active in the Royal Society both predicates misrepresent this English gentleman who wrote extensively on mathematics and religion Likewise owing to his overrigid use of categories Kemp characterises David Brewster the most eulogistic of Newtons nineteenthcentury biographers as an ‘antiNewtonian’p 300 A related and equally significant problem arises from Kemps search for causal historical relations between science and art Questions of historical influence feature prominently in this study Kemp frequently provides details of superficial social acquaintance between scientists and artists and refers to their reading habits This is in one sense unobjectionable and Kemp rightly weighs the evidence for influence circumspectly However the very preoccupation with identifying causal influences begs more fundamental questions about whether contemporaries shared intellectual assumptions For example the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century was constituted not only by the new theories of Descartes Galileo and Newton but also by new ways of experiencing the world interacting with it and thinking about it According to this claim the mores of the eighteenth century were radically different from the sixteenth Yet this difference is somewhat obscured in Kemps analysis by his concern to explicate the details of numerous perspective schemes and the techniques employed by artists He thereby pays less attention than he might to interpreting the science of art as a cultural phenomenon Ideological and philosophical issues receive inadequate attention and yet these could have helped define the common context or perhaps the contrasting contexts in which art and science were pursued Again Kemps subject raises important questions about the structure and function of institutions which he only engages parenthetically More generally a less causal and more structural approach might have been fruitful in illuminating the historical conditioning of the science of art Another example of a terminological difficulty arises in the section in which Kemp briefly examines the relation between perspective and eighteenthcentury theories of perception Unfortunately he predicates his discussion on the contrast between ‘empiricists’ and ‘nativists’ a distinction he soon recognises as inadequate In the light of Kemps historiography it is not surprising that he concludes that ideas about perception which were often explicitly discussed by ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers had little impact on artists p 237 While he has usefully identified theories of perception as an aspect of the science of art they deserve a more eclectic and sustained analysis Let me therefore mention briefly some further dimensions of the subject Many artists scientists and philosophers engaged the question of whether linear or any other perspective provides the true account of how we perceive For some authors perspective provides both the laws of perception and also the key to the true and rational representation of objects Learn perspective and you can imitate nature precisely However many artists seriously questioned this wisdom In their art they combined perspective with drawing ‘by eye’ they instinctively knew when to follow the rules and when to break them This for Kemp is an important clue to the success of Velázquez and Turner for whom perspective was a useful servant but a poor master But artists were not alone in considering and debating the truth and limitations of perspective A related point on which most but not all physical scientists or more appropriately natural philosophers of the seventeenth century would have agreed was the primacy of mathematics in analysing the physical universe Their reasons for adopting this view differed somewhat but we can take Galileos position as not atypical Echoing Plato Galileo claimed that God had created the world according to mathematical proportions This implied that only in the sphere of the mathematical sciences can the human intellect attain knowledge that is as objective and as certain as it is known to the divine mind Through mathematics truth and reality could be laid bare and appearances transcended This metaphysical commitment came under scrutiny not only from those artists who refused to be limited by the laws of perspective but also from ‘scientists’ and ‘philosophers’ One of the most forceful attacks was by George Berkeley in his An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision 1709 Here Berkeley argued strenuously against the view that we judge the distance of objects by means of lines and angles Although most commentators have claimed that Berkeleys principal opponent was Descartes whom he cited as an example only in the second 1710 edition he was more generally denying the widelyreceived assumption that we see according to the laws of geometry — this assumption being central to the perspectivist tradition Berkeley was familiar with perspective machines one of which he described in a later work Instead Berkeley sought to show that we learn to judge the distance magnitude and situation of objects This controversial book was widely discussed but whether it was read by artists I leave to further research Berkeley was not alone in questioning whether geometrical methods are adequate to account for visual perception since there was a large literature on the subject by ‘scientists’ and as Kemp shows artists also frequently commented on it One of the leading problems in this area was the horizontal moon illusion the moon appears larger near the horizon than in its zenith Since Ptolemy tried to solve this problem in the second century it has been on the agenda of theorists of perception and is still I understand not fully resolved In the eighteenth century it was one of the main test cases for the dominance of geometry Attacks on geometricallybased theories of vision together with the deployment of such examples as the horizontal moon illusion provide a theme of common concern to artists scientists and philosophers and deserve further analysis than Kemp offers If there are aspects of the science of art that Kemp fails to engage adequately the scope of this book is nevertheless very impressive and a number of the issues he discusses impinge on my concerns as an historian of science Let me allude to two of these issues In the history of science theoria has usually been accorded far greater importance than praxis The general view has been that theoria is the engine driving the historical development of science and that praxis is merely the application of theoria Although some historians often Marxists have rejected this consensus only recently have aspects of praxis such as laboratory skills been subjected to close and sustained study In this respect the  historian of science has much to learn from an art historian like Kemp Moreover the analysis of skills provides a common topic of research for both art and science historians The second issue concerns the artscience relationship which Kemp analyses through the history of perspective and of colour The latter case is the more straightforward since he presents the impact of Newtons theory of coloured light as radically reorientating this area With perspective the key figures of the Scientific Revolution are presented as the heirs to developments in art For example we encounter Galileo as a bitplayer who corresponded with Lodovico Cigoli over his lunar and sunspot observations More particularly Galileo used standard perspective procedures in accounting for the foreshortening of the spots which he claimed in 1613 were on the surface of the sun Unfortunately Kepler receives even less attention Yet in 1600 Kepler made important contributions to optical science especially to the theory of image formation Keplers concern with the formation of images was a response to a practical problem He noticed that when viewed with a camera obscura the image of the sun was too large but this enlargement was not explained by existing theory Instead he conceived every illuminated point being the source of rays spreading in all directions a bundle of these rays rather than a single ray pass through the hole in a camera obscuraor the pupil of the eye Thus the image is enlarged owing to the finite size of the hole In his resolution of the problem Kepler represented his rays by strings For example in ascertaining the image of a book on a distant plane he adopted a procedure familiar to artists for almost a century He used a stretched string to plot ray paths that just grazed the book in their transit from the source of the screen This method of repeatedly deploying a stretched string to plot the light rays and thus ascertain selected points on an image was incorporated into the perspective machines described by Leonardo and Dürer While the example of Kepler illustrates the influence of artistic practice on a ‘scientist’which is not Kemps primary concern discussion of this instance would have enhanced considerably the authors argument that both the theory and practice of perspective were significant resources for the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century He also argues that in its turn the Scientific Revolution had some effect on the visual arts Military engineers who were also often mathematicians such as Simon Stevin and Girard Desargues contributed significantly to the subject of perspective Newton is portrayed as influencing eighteenthcentury perspective in an unspecified manner although his effect on colour theory is seen as considerable However on Kemps account few artists took notice of the philosophical mathematical and scientific innovations of Descartes and Kepler By the eighteenth century there was a considerable parting of the ways since the more erudite mathematical treatises on perspective such as those by Lambert and Monge were of no use to the practising artist Even optical instruments such as perspective machines the camera obscura and the camera lucida were used sparingly It appears that once science gained its independent identity scientists and artists used perspective for increasingly different purposes As with de Santillanas innovatory essay Kemps book not only offers new ways of understanding the history of science and the history of art but it also raises a host of historical and historiographical questions These questions in turn suggest further lines of research that deserve serious attention by historians of both science and art Kemp has performed a valuable service in opening up this area I hope other historians will now follow his lead ON THE PASSAGE OF A FEW PEOPLE SITUATIONIST NOSTALGIA PETER SMITH An endless adventure…an endless passion…an endless banquet A Situationist Scrapbook

People Through a Brief Moment in Time The Situationist International 1957 — 1972 edited by Elisabeth Sussman The MIT PressICA Boston Massachusetts 1989 200 pp ISBN 0860919838 £1995 I These books are both related to the exhibition On The Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Period of Time presented at the Musée national dart moderneCentre Georges Pompidou the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston Massachusetts during 1989 — 90 The exhibition was conceived and realised by Mark Francis and Peter Wollen with Paul Hervé Parsy Francis and Wollen have also contributed articles one each both of which appear in both books as introductory statements on the Situationist International Both books are anthologies of materials by a large number of contributors Their titles invoke the Situationists rhetorical use of long and rhapsodic titles They also denote deliberate obfuscations deriving from Dada and Surrealism On the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time henceforth ‘the Boston text is a film title used by Guy Debord in 1959 The Situationist Scrapbook includes only two synoptical essays the rest being made up of a selection of documents produced in various parts of Europe and Britain from the fifties to the eighties some of which predate the founding of the Situationist International henceforth the ‘SI These are followed by documents relating to the SI in Britain which include Ralph Rumneys Psychogeographic Map of Venice 1957 and brief statements by Michèle Bernstein which appear in the British press in the 1950s and 1960s The greater part of the Scrapbook largely consists of what the editor identifies as ‘the British inheritance’ which covers the period from 1966 — 1988 The book is therefore very much an account of the movements influence in Britain The Boston text relates more exclusively to the movement itself and includes along with historical material a brief statement by Mark Francis which is intended to justify and explain the motives behind the exhibition the Situationists did not give the event their blessings and none of the past members participated in its planning ‘What we have sought to do’ claims Francis speaking for the organisers of the exhibition ‘is not to reconstruct time past but to expose to the light things that have run the risk of acquiring the patina of nostalgia and the glamour of neglect’ If this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the Situationist project and their condemnation of the art world Francis also implies somewhat unconvincingly that the event was conceived in a spirit of Potlatch and accepts the Lettrist belief in the legitimate use of plagiarism The Lettrists and the Situationists had used ‘preexisting elements’ for their own ends and so the editors of the Boston text and the curators of On the Passage have they feel a certain entitlement to do the same This legitimation in turn is related to the principle of détournement  a term which had been coined initially by the Lettrists for their neoDadaist practice of cannibalising preexistent materials in the manner of Duchamps LHOOQ  with subversive intent My view of the exhibition and these complementary texts is that they seem for the most part to lack the critical motivation and the dialectical irony of the Situationists They are normative representations reverential in tone recuperative in effect and the ideological positions which they reflect are conveniently distanced from those of the SI Selfevidently these texts are strikingly different from original materials issued by the SI in the sense that they have the status of copyrighted property and have been funded by organisations which in the past may have supported progressive art but which do not sound like the champions of revolutionary causes The Boston text for example is published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program Massachusetts Council of the Arts and the Humanities and additional funding is provided by the Lila Wallace Readers Digest Fund the benefactor of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York The Scrapbook is also variously supported by Association Française dAction Artistique the Ministry of Culture Copenhagen the Instituo Banco San Paulo of Turin Becks Bier to name some of the backers and also by the furtively named Friends of the Situationist International whoever they are More prosaically the sandpaper cover which like the JornDebord text Mémoires of  1959 is meant to damage your other books was donated by English Abrasives and Chemicals Ltd One of the first ‘political’ statements in the Boston text is the copyright restriction notice It appears a few lines away from the plagiarised title of the book The proscription is of course a legal convention which we would normally take for granted but is in this context inconsistent with the SI anticopyright policy and in the light of the Lautréamont axiom ‘Plagiarism is necessary — progress implies it’ which Francis cites on page 19 is an unintended irony The Boston text is more obviously an exhibition catalogue if only because it includes a ‘checklist’ of the exhibition which ignoring the problematic identity of some of the works distinguishes between works of art and other items books tracts pamphlets etc and also carefully identifies the status of individual exhibits by signifying their producers relationship to the formally identified Situationist group There is another category for Situationist wannabees which was an additional and problematical area of both books and the exhibition Some of the materials in this area seemed to have the purpose of padding out the exhibition whilst at the same time fulfilling the traditional function of consolidating the achievements of the founding group whose significance it was the purpose of the exhibition to celebrate Francis identifies the stages of the SI narrative as a chronological trajectory corresponding to i the Experimental Laboratory periodii the detonator period which refers to Debords boast that he provided the explosive machinery that ignited in May 1968iii the Fallout period after the SI disbanded in 1972 These stages provide the logic for the ‘diachronic structure’ of the exhibition In the Fallout section are included artists writers and others ‘who all had sic some contact with the SI’ Periodisation and classification present some difficulties which Wollen hints at when he comments on ‘the ‘simulationist’ art boom of the eighties and its debt to the dry husks of Situationist thought’ It is to be regretted that neither of these books examine the pluralism of the ‘simulationist’ period To the extent that the Situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the ‘supersession’ of art how should we judge the Fallout period The notion of progression is clearly important in assessing this work especially as the temptation to isolate or even dismiss it as an epiphenomenon of the SI is strong The materials displayed in the exhibition and reproduced in the Fallout section of the Scrapbook no doubt express ideas about which strong convictions are held What are these convictions and why are they not articulated Why were the exhibits left to speak for themselves It seems extraordinary that given the political fervour of the Parisbased SI fraction in its postLettrist phase the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to Debords caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market Whatever objectives the organisers might have had the exhibition turned out to be a quite normative curatorial project The contradiction is perhaps a familiar one As Debord has commented ‘This society signs a peace treaty with its most outspoken enemies by giving them a spot in the spectacle It is noteworthy that the Situationists have produced nothing in the way of new projects for these texts nor for the exhibition Predictably they kept their distance At the centre of the regrouped SI in 1961 Bernstein and Debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity It was at this time that Asgerjorn resigned his membership of the SI although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s Thus regrouped the SI increased their political activity eliminating all artistic production except in terms of agitational forms which meant essentially the use of détourné illustrations in their publications The article by Wollen is an important piece of research and a major contribution to both anthologies Despite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject it does however judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase Nevertheless Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for André Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history He also traces the Hegelian and Lukácsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual atmosphere after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists Apart from Wollens historical and theoretical essay the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y Levins ‘Dismantling the Spectacle The Cinema of Guy Debord’ This is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English Levin makes a special case for Debord as a filmmaker whose aim was to contribute to the ultimate destruction of cinema as a spectacularist medium Debords cinema for Levin is a paradigmatic vehicle for the movements ‘destructive creativity’ The main purpose of Levins article however is to reclaim Debord for the aesthetic discourse of avantgarde cinema For example he identifies Debord as the source of Godards innovations ‘Indeed well over a decade before Godards Vent dEst  Debord was producing a revolutionary materialist ‘countercinema’’ Not having seen Debords films he refused screenings at the ICA in London Levins arguments are in one sense untestable nevertheless the article is not without difficulties Defensively he observes what he considers to be Debords virtues and comments on the latters avoidance of as he puts it ‘the various pitfalls — formalist essentialism aestheticist myopia politically naive fetishism of reflexivity and so on typical of certain avantgarde practices linked to radical political agendas’ Nevertheless Debords place within a reified history of ‘political modernism’ is assured more by virtue of what is claimed for the work than by its testing in public— Levin admits that screenings have been rare especially outside France Both the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived Further to this Levin claims that Debord ‘does not disparage pleasure’ and yet argues elsewhere in the essay that his films deliberately refuse to make concessions to the viewer An example of this is the early Lettrist film Hurlement en faveur de Sade  with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences As far as one can assess the merit of Levins text in relation to its subject it seems somewhat implausible that Debord can be all the things for which he is proclaimed Whatever defence is mounted it is clear that these films for Levin exist as auratic objects and Debord their auraticised progenitor Hence the mythologisation of Debord by Levin and others has a significant bearing upon the reception of his work His remoteness and the scandal and intrigue associated with the SI have significantly contributed to the enhancement of the movements reputation Levins essay interesting though it is achieves little more than assimilating Debord into the spectacularised history of the avantgarde cinema His heroworship results in him reiterating the same claims that the cinéaste makes for himself In the opening sequence of Hurlement  as Levin notes Debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated The tradition includes ‘great landmarks’ in film history from early ‘genre classicsLevins term Expressionist Dada Soviet cinema of the 1920s Surrealist Chaplin Lettrist and last but not least Debord Situationist cinema is therefore important indeed selfimportant not least because it provides ‘an alternative sort of cinematic activity incompatible with the economy of the spectacle’ Levin earnestly considers Situationist film to be an effective oppositional practice One of the attractions for Levin is the persistency with which Debord like the Dadaists before him continued to explore the medium whilst contributing to its eventual destruction Moreover Levin claims that the Situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions ‘by consenting to act in culture’ as a precondition of their coexistence in the present order Nevertheless cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in Levins tribute It is like Hegels notion of the beautiful soul which denounces the world from which it has withdrawn to avoid having to recognise the extent of its participation in its disorder Debord as a filmmaker and Levin as his apologist take refuge in the transcendental space of autonomy where meanings have the illusion of selfregulation and independence of the totality they represent Debord takes up his place certainly in Levins account within the lineage of modern masters with its attendant construction of patriarchy distinction and causal succession In Levins essay avantgarde cinema is assimilated into the wider discourse of Modernist art despite their material and institutional differences One of the pitfalls of this is that different audiences and different modes of consumption are contingencies largely ignored Debords apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in Levins emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history The blurring of art and film histories leads Levin into the murky waters of Situationist discourse on art Suffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate and lacks depth and clarity Debord for example proclaims ‘The critical position later elaborated by the Situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art There is some sense in this comment which may well explain the position of the Situationists at a particular conjunction but it is a sense which would also explain earlier avantgarde trends in art if not cinema since say Futurism Moreover the notion of arts ‘single supersession’ an histrionic claim would benefit from some kind of historical and theoretical contextualisation It sounds important but in fact is an impenetrable statement Further clarification might also be required as to how the Situationist negation of art and cinema related to the wider sphere of culturalpolitical struggle The critique of art as an institution is continuous with earlier formations including early Surrealism and Russian Constructivism but Levin remains unclear in his definition of Debords avantgardism For Lukács and Adorno the concept of the avantgarde was a touchstone for the one it was negative and decadent for the other positive and progressive In Levins account of Debord his subject appears to hold both positions at once More specifically on the issue of cultural hierarchies and class relations the Situationists tried to distance themselves from bourgeois notions of progress and their equivalence in the neoavantgarde of the postwar period The SI thus rejected ‘mechanical becoming with its notions of progress merit and causal succession’ This statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism out of which lineages are made but in Levins history the independent achievements of Debord as a filmmaker eventually collapses into it In fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism and from naive realism the politics of the signified He does this by proclaiming a ‘third avantgarde’ which avoids the major pitfalls of the ‘two avantgardes and secures some theoretical authority for Debord However because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected  means theoretical or practical by which the sublation of art in the praxis of life might be achieved The reverential tone of Levins text poses a problem which the movements survivors I imagine would be quick to condemn It is in short uncritical in the sense of failing to site Debords films within an adequate theoretical discourse Levin objectifies his subject through the use of an argument which leaves the SI unexplained as a revolutionary organisation with the potentiality of reflecting by its own methods a radical social transformation What he provides is the missing chapter in the secret history of the cinema the missing link between Berlin Dada and postmodernism As with other contributors exaggerated claims are made for détournement the communication which contains its own critique firstly because it was an inheritance from Cubism and Dada and secondly because as the exhibition shows its deployment by ‘prositus’ has made of it a commonplace popularised in punk fanzines and ‘Biff’postcards etc The Situationists activities within the cultural sphere constituted an attempt to create a unified range of activities which functioned as a radical critique of the conventional boundaries between specialisations embedded in the institutions practices and agencies of modern life The fragmented appearance of their work especially its Lettrist phase their repudiation of conventional skills and scholarly manners evidenced in their use of personal insults have been absorbed by subcultural milieux and in due course adapted by the culture industries The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated if overstated in these books If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed SI through Fluxus Heatwave King Mob Jamie Reid Vivienne Westwood and the Sex Pistols the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence typified by King Mob in Britain the Motherfuckers in the USA and also indirectly the punk phenomenon but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large degree derives from Marxs critique of alienation and commodity fetishism Lukácss development of this critique and the Marxistexistentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers Council after World War One provided a readymade model of a nonhierarchical political system The simple faith conveyed in Pannekoeks treatise recalls earlier utopian writing and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of Situationist writing With the exception of Wollen the contributors to the Scrapbook and the Boston text convey little concern for the forms of political organisation espoused by the Situationists and it is perhaps symptomatic of their interest in the SI as a purely aesthetic phenomenon The SI clearly endeavoured to produce a revolutionary critique of modern life and towards this end devised a convulsive rhetoric and an inventive vocabulary The revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this rather than by its standing as a political organisation The remoteness of the movement from workingclass experience guaranteed the survival of its bohemian image Its reemergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties Paris a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names The Boston text reproduces old photographs of founding members The gamine looks of Bernstein and the neatness of Debord have an aesthetic relevance which signifies a rather vague but nevertheless compelling reason for their inclusion in the text They are not merely documentation They are in fact significant elements in the story of ‘Situationism’ which is the subtext of the book The political reticence evident in these volumes is indicated by a degree of randomness in the choice of materials and by implication a commitment to the more ‘expressive’ or irrationalist side of their work It is for example revealing that there is no indication in either book of the Situationist commitment to political struggles in the Third World and their critique of imperialism The introductions in both books are anodyne and brief The historical significance of the SI is not questioned and the importance of the movement is asserted largely on the basis of aesthetic innovations which derive from the Lettrist period prior to the founding of the SI Détournement and dérive drifting are thus reclaimed in terms of their contemporary relevance or rather for the extent to which they influenced punk and the camp and erudite artistic radicalism which exploited it With the exception of Levins extended analysis of film neither the products nor any specific agitations of the Situationists and their epigones are subject to critical reassessment The short commentaries and comic imagery in the British section of the Scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions Some of it is amusing some of it pretentious drivel Clearly much of the material is unsupportable and there is a sense in which this is selfevident in that the Scrapbook is styled as an ‘antidocument’ which like the films of Debord is coextensive with the equally unsupportable and qualitatively diminished world to which it relates The temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the Situationist project it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal The  tendency is to ignore value distinctions and to undermine qualitative difference so that popular and high art genres are presented side by side in a unified space or text There is of course an inside knowledge which makes this ‘coherent’ for those in possession of it This presupposes the same audience separations the same hierarchies the same educational and class difference as before Frank Mort has commented on this kind of separation between the new intellectuals who are happy and confident to mix genre and ignore qualitative and semantic difference ‘because they already know the map of Western culture’ and are distinct from those ‘who do not carry with them those levels of cultural capital’ He adds to this ‘In that sense postmodern discourse with its relativism its denial of grand narratives and its refusal of questions of value is a world tailormade for the new metropolitan intellectual cadres It therefore seems that ‘in a purely negative way’ the silence over the question of meaning in the Boston text and in the Scrapbook is perhaps not surprising —— it is an historically appropriate response to the disappearance of the SI ‘There is a sorrow in the Zeitgeist’ bemoans Lyotard an inappropriateness in the metaphor of the ‘avantgarde’ and consequently a kind of absurdity attaching to the belief in art as a prefiguration of a global collectivist future That sorrow hangs over the discontinued struggles of the SI The belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear as if they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day II What I have argued so far is that the Situationists are illserved by these publications and that this is partly due to the influence of a certain pessimism which haunts contemporary cultural politics What I want to argue now is that there is a sense in which the symptom of this pessimism exist in the movement itself The Situationists were idealists in the sense that they perceived themselves apart from the spectacle always managing to be ‘otherthanspectacular’ as Levin puts it so that this became a precondition of Situationist practice Their selfimage was that of the chosen few for whom the spectacle provided an inexhaustible supply of objects and people to hate and whilst the apparent ease with which they targeted and disposed of their opposition often made good copy the endless adventure the scandal etc there is a sense in which the hectoring tone of their documents became repetitive and wearisome The effusions of Vaneigem have an air of mystical revelation which is even more intense in recent publications Debords political fatigue is less evident but his filmwork has finished and he refuses to permit distribution and screening of his work in this medium Bernstein is now a journalist and works for a French newspaper There are I think just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook They appear in the documents section and therefore do not we may take it represent the views of the editors Firstly Art  Languages piece ‘Ralph the Situationist’ expresses considerable misgivings about the Situationist project ‘The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating…’ ‘…bland incoherence — a selfcontradictory absurdity — a moral ground to give up reading and remembering…’ and so on Whatever gave Francis or whoever it was the idea that Art  Language had anything to do with the Situationists On what basis is this reference made There is no evidence of SI influence in their work which has quite different intellectual roots and the article itself leaves no doubt as to the extent of their disapprobation Furthermore the inclusion of three early works by the group in the exhibition dating from the late sixties reveals a kind of make believe idea about an A  LSI connection There was no such connection As late as 1970 members of A  L to my knowledge had never heard of Debord and if they had were not the least bit interested The arbitrary inclusion of artworks in the exhibition is further evidence of a curatorial effort to construct a narrative of ‘situationism’ The case for Merz Pistoletto and Buren may be different but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for they are merely dogmatically asserted Given the withering contempt expressed by the Situationists for ‘prositus’ one shudders to think what Debord et al  are going to make of the ‘quasisituationists’ discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann On the basis of her understanding it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media and I can think of a good many is veritably a ‘quasisituationist’ The desire to create a pseudohistory of the movements afterlife may be good for business and may have provided extra material for the book I refer to the Boston text see pp 10–13 but it is not in keeping with the purer aims of the Situationists outlined elsewhere in these and other texts The second critical comment I came across in the Scrapbook was George Steiners statement from the Sunday Times in 1967 Steiner accepted that the Situationists had identified and accurately described the emptiness of everyday life and even accepts their pleas for subversion but was very sour about what he described as the ‘depressingly banal’ prescriptions of Debord and the ‘turgid creed’of Vaneigem Christopher Gray one of the small number of English members of the SI is the third commentator I found to be not entirely sympathetic His comments come from an anthology of Situationist writings he edited in 1974 Grays comments evoke a kind of mystical disenchantment with the movement  which he found to be too focused on an intellectual critique of society ‘There was’ he complains ‘no concern whatever with either emotions or the body The SI thought you just had to show how the nightmare worked and everyone would wake up Their quest was for the perfect formula The history of the SI is in some ways a struggle for recognition despite Debords evasions sustained by a radically negative critique which ultimately failed to find a middle way between Hegelian metaphysics and the dynamics of political organisation in the pursuit of its utopian objectives The declamatory style of writing which now seems dated too often obscured the probity of the Situationists critique of the alienating and manipulative effects of late capitalism and its creation of pseudoneeds The movements critique proclaimed a uniqueness and originality for its discoveries to which it was never entitled and which served only to reinforce the selfdeluding image of its own power and influence in the world Antiauthoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had of course been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957 The rejection of trade unionism was a common demand amongst anarchists and libertarian socialists At the end of her life Rosa Luxembourg called for the abolishment of trade unions and promoted the view that workers councils were essential organisations in the establishment of socialism More generally the idea of the inseparability of cultural and political revolution has a long history within the libertarian tradition with its roots in revolutionary Romanticism The more direct inspiration for the Situationists was the DadaLettrist connection which provided the aesthetic and political basis for their adoption of noncognitive methods of expression such as automatism chance and other depersonalising techniques of production and also led to the definition of some key terms in their vocabulary The critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in Marxist debate in the twentieth century The Situationists contribution to this was negligible The Frankfurt Schools Marxian approach to cultural criticism and production and the social effects of technology and the culture industries predates the writings of Debord and yet despite its relative lack of revolutionary fervour remains a far more wideranging and thoroughgoing critique of the field The conjunction of passion and knowledge of libertarianism and planning of feeling and thought are conventional oppositions in postEnlightenment thought which have also bedevilled Marxism The more orthodox theorists in this tradition have preserved this separation along the lines of a RomanticistUtilitarian split Others have sought a reconciliation of the positions that these terms represent and there is an abundance of literature which examines this relationship in advance of the Situationists If the Situationist project is flawed as I believe it is it is not because antecedent theories of libertarians Marxists and Council Communists are ignored by them but rather because they lacked the will to build on this tradition a systematic utopianism consisting of critique and plausible projections into the future Like the Surrealists before them their transcendence of alienation remains abstractly utopian Despite revolutionary zeal or perhaps because of it they sought immediate compensations for the miseries of daily life and spontaneous methods of attack which they mistook for political strategy The Situationists strategy consisted of an exploratory utopianism — a kind of heuristic projection of a future society Raymond Williams has remarked that the danger of the heuristic utopia is that it ‘can settle into isolated and sentimental desire a means of living with alienation’ Another Surrealist inheritance which distances Situationists from the more radical utopians is their blanket condemnation of work ‘Never work’ announced the Surrealists It is an amusing quip especially for those with private means and makes joyful and nonsensical graffiti But what does it mean Obviously it is an incitement to refusal and an indictment of alienated labour The refusal is as understandable as it is naive but seems to constitute at the same time what amounts to an abnegation of intellectual curiosity about human needs Its political inflexion contests the middleclass work ethic which is the main purpose of its message The aristocracy for its part has never needed to be convinced of the importance of not working For other theorists such as William Morris the concept of work is not considered negatively Indeed for Morris and other Marxists the nature of work necessarily changes in the process of social transformation Marx defined labour as ‘human sensuous activity’ Lukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice The plea for an understanding of ‘totality’ in Situationist writing derives from Lukács and Marx whose critique of ‘separation’is directed exactly at the workleisure distinction Asger Jorns interest in folk cultures and tribal societies which lacked a notion of ‘art’ as a distinct intellectual practice separated from the common culture was based on an understanding of the extent to which the spheres of art and work have become conflicting practices within bourgeois relations of production Despite this the common tendency in SI writing on most forms of directed or purposeful activity other than agitation or ‘destructive creativity is negative The aristocratic disdain for manual labour has its counterpart in the Situationist’ attitude to the working class considered as the moronised victims of the spectacle In contrast the Situationists notion of pleasure is a negation of work in almost every sense of the word — a kind of involuntary idleness in the land of Cockaigne Their notion of pleasure is indistinguishable from a sixties Zeitgeist Its meaning is inadequately theorised and remains largely at the  level of common sense a crude alternative to the repressive order of work Now that Situationist texts are widely available and with these publications adding to the list it is ironic that they seem less crucial than they once did Their appeal in the past was partly attributable to the popular texture of some aspects of the writing its accessibility and its festive and irreverent politics These writings appealed essentially to a generation of students bored with academic life and attracted by the street credibility of the Situationists and often provided students with the dubious pleasure of being flattered and insulted at the same time The Situationist lifestyle in so far as it could be imagined had some influence on the hippy subculture in the late sixties and punk ideology in the seventies in Britain Situationist influence was more menacingly felt in France especially in the universities although it has to be said that their influence upon the events of May 1968 has been exaggerated For the most part however the legacy of the movement remained less obviously political and restricted in its appeal to fairly specific audiences in the cultural milieu and especially the visual arts Indeed the extent to which the Situationist influence has flourished in the spheres of art and popular culture is noteworthy and contrasts with the absence of the movements influence in other domains The uneven profile of the Situationist group and its existential fragmentation together with the eclectic and impromptu formal character of the artefacts they produced as I have suggested above make it an ideal type for the postmodernist critic The Situationists rejection of the classical model of leftwing monumentalism and their apparent lack of commitment to the historical overview or the grand narrative is consistent with postmodernism Moreover the freedom with which they juxtapose theory and humour and plagiarise for artistic effect suggests strong affinity with the postmodern The decline of the metanarrative in favour of aphoristic models of philosophical expression following Feuerbach and Nietzche has been the favoured form of the Situationists The fact that Baudrillards name has been linked with the Situationists should not be held against them Nevertheless the deMarxisation of their project by him and the ‘death of the social’ which he has announced should alert us to the doubts raised by Raymond Williams on the issue of certain types of Utopianism The concept of the spectacle is an effective term which now has a wide currency but perhaps only in a sense which approximates its use by the Situationists The historical period which has seen its political devaluation is one in which political optimism has become unfashionable which perhaps is one way of explaining the retrospective or merely historicist character of the Situationist exhibition and the books I have reviewed We have seen a shift from the utopianism of the 1960s to a culture of nostalgia and as with the more dystopian elements in postmodernism the exhibition and the books which accompany it look backward in a search for appearances as if they were compensatory fantasies substituting for a forgotten dream'

    [" Thanks for that John Hall now John Hall will be listening for the next hour 'cos Angus Stewart is here to take your calls eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two something in the garden that's causing you problems give us a call right now and Angus can I mean y'know he is known in the trade as Mr popergation  Mr propagation. He's also known for his passion for natives and his love of o orchids am I right so far.\n I guess yeah yeah .\n He's also known  for his ability to open cosposting  toilets so he can tell you anything worm farm problems certainly helped us and although I'm still confused about dry ingredients we might talk about that as well but eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two fine sunny day today top temperatures on the coast of twenty-seven inland thirty degrees Bowral enjoying twenty-seven and Katoomba twenty-five degrees currently around town on the coast it's seventeen that's four below   r Richmond and Bankstown are fifteen degrees Penrith sixteen Katoomba thirteen and Gosford twelve. One of the jewels in the open garden scheme crown is opening today and this is just a garden to envy how would you like   to have   a beautiful sandstone cottage nestled underneath a waterfall with a little pond and then a creek that runs through with thousands of water dragons so tame they come up and just   kiss you. Would you like to live there.\n Okay.\n Jeanne Villani does and we'll find out the secret of her open garden and give you the address so that you can go along today and tomorrow to see Waterfall Cottage which is a part of the open garden scheme all this and more because it is Saturday.\n\n\n Eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two Suzanne's on the line in McMahon's Point and.\n Hello.\n How are you.\n I'm good thank you.\n You've got a big fat  Morton Bay fig.\n Well it's not that bit it's um it's about three feet 'cos I only know feet . About three feet high and um it's been doing so well my partner actually grew it from a seed we picked it up in a church garden  and our intention was to buy a house and plant it but we haven't got the house yet. So we've still got the fig and it's doing so well until recently. My um I think it's under stress God knows why  it's only on a balcony in a pot but it's getting a sort first of all I thought it was sunburn but the the leaves are getting oh um a pale ring and then after a while they crack . And   and then they break off first of all I thought oh golly it's a bug or something eating it. But no it seems to be happening as they're growing they're perfectly fine and then intermittently they get this it's it's as if somebody has um um put some hydrogen peroxide on them or something and then.\n Is there plenty of drainage in the pot.\n Yes uhuh um plenty I'm just wondering well obviously it's gotta come out of the pot and be planted in   a proper place but.\n You think it's a case of Free Willy it wants to just go into the  into the open.\n It does 'cos it's meant.\n I don't know Angus is that the case.\n Well the symptoms you describe um it it sounds could it possibly be water stress. Do you think the plant could be drying out from time to time.\n Yeah well it could be maybe I'm not giving it enough.\n Yeah they uh I mean they are a a rainforest tree that that's used to fairly constant moisture and and mulch y'know plenty of leaf mulch uh froh in the natural sort of environment um.\n Should I feed it some more. Ih feed it .\n Well I don't I wouldn't be so concerned about the feeding uh I mean what what you're in really is a sort of a holding operation.\n Yes that was the idea.\n So I think uh if you encourage more growth uh the plant's going to become uh more and more pot bound . Suh so I would be thinking about putting it into a uh a slightly larger container and just gradually moving it up a a container size every year.\n Which I we have been doing it's about   oh it would be about three and a half years old now . And uh God knows how we're going to get it out of this pot . Um I it reminds me of what happens to a gardenia when it hasn't got  when you need to give it Epsom salts.\n Right.\n That's that's the sort of thing that seems to be happening with it. W would it.\n So it's sort of a yellowing of the   the foliage gradually.\n Yes only in a certain area and then that uh pale part breaks.\n Right yeah yep is it in the older foliage that you're noticing that. Or the new growth.\n Wih uh no um   yes it is well it is in the older foliage but  I notice that with the new growth   it's starting to happen too.\n Yes well it yeah cih t obviously the a lack of nutrients would tend to make it pale off a bit but uh  uh perhaps you could just give it the occasional liquid feed. Uh one of the sorta complete liquid feeds that are on the market you can water that over the foliage and it will sorta feed those leaves 'n' 'n' keep them healthy  and I think just uh repotting it uh every year as you've been doing giving it a l bit more space um that's the way to go and they're pretty tough plants too so.\n I'd hate to be be responsible for anything bad happening to it.\n Yeah.\n So maybe I should find a park somewhere.\n Well that's that's yeah  they do need a lotta space  a park is a good option so.\n Mm mm.\n Well good luck with Suzanne.\n Okay thank you very much Simon love your show.\n Thanks for being on it.\n Thank you bye.\n The perplexing Morton Bay fig problem they are beautiful trees though how long do they take the ones that we see round town that are humungous.\n Mm.\n How long how old would they be roughly.\n Well you're looking at hundred  years plus those huge buttress roots and that kind of thing ih they're just uh extraordinary.\n And we've come to understand now that we should have lots of h h not hummus or tabouli but humus underneath the roots and uh those  uh the beautiful air breathing s almost  aerial roots.\n That's what they are exactly they're they're sort of support roots but they do like very well aerated conditions so grow them in a pot is quite feasible but uh they do like that constant moisture th that is provided by the humus that you mentioned Simon.\n And what about the um you know the the not ikebana the the the  bonsai-ing them can you bonsai them.\n Ah yes they make  fabulous bonsais.\n Maybe that would be Suzanne's option is to bonsai it.\n Well I c could be s recommended that's for sure.\n McMahon's Point she's right near North Sydney library she could wander up there and uh have a get a bonsai book out 'n' have her   portable   Morton Bay fig.\n I love it. Good bonsai with a bit of suiseki around the base.\n And a touch of wasabi bit of soya sauce  tastes beautiful.\n\n\n Ah Lisa's on the line in Cammeray you've got mutant gardenias from another planet Lisa.\n I have Simon good morning. Um I have some potted gardenias um which I've had for a while they we went away they dried out they were almost dead and I thought   trying to resurrect them I just cut them back until I found green.\n Mm.\n They've grown back. Beautifully.\n Good on you.\n But some of the leaves are enormous they're like sixteen centimetres long.\n Yes.\n Um but then others are normal size .\n Mm.\n Sixteen centimetres.\n Sixteen  it's true I had a witness yesterday we measured it just to make sure I wasn't going completely mad um but yes  I don't know why.\n Is it growing a little sort of like whip spike out of the centre and feet from the side.\n No no triffid um  attributes or anything it is just the the I mean the leaves I mean it's been attacked by a by a caterpillar as well which I've managed to pick off most of those and I've got those under control but the  new leaf growth is just amazing it's glossy there's nothing wrong with it it uh  I mean it's just sprouting everywhere but some of the leaves are just huge.\n Is that normal  for a gardenia Angus.\n Well I wouldn't say normal it uh but it plants will respond to to environmental conditions so it sounds like it's been on a very good paddock . If I could say that you've been uh obviously feeding it uh quite well by the sound of things.\n Well  look let me put it this way uh my green thumb is sort of uh more like a green fingertip  I'm not exactly um y'know terrific  in the garden I'm like I put in an effort  but I I just gave uh look I did um to resurrect them a little bit I put some Seasol on them to  to try and get ev y'know remuh mulch the soil that sort of thing  get them back on track and then a slow r release fertiliser buh buh but that was about it.\n Well that's uh that's the idea though with those slow release fertilisers they're  they the nutrients are always there for the plant and it's uh   yeah it's literally on a very good paddock uh but also light conditions can play a part as well um leaves will will respond to the environment and if there's a lower light level they can enlarge and and become a a darker green because there's more chlorophyll to catch the available light  that sort of thing. So is it in a shadier usually.\n Well actually I uh I h I have to really keep the water up to them because they it gets sun most of the time  but then by afternoon um we've got a sort of a m a mirella um sorta planted not far from it. I think it shadows the plant significantly in the afternoon I don't know if  if that makes a difference I mean like.\n Well it will.\n Yeah.\n Yeah I would suggest uh s the leaves are just uh trying to catch as much light as possible   um so I yeah I don't think it's anything to worry about sounds to me like uh.\nIt's saying thank you.\n It's saying thank you.\n I'm just .\n Might need to get it a personal trainer and wear off a bit  of that weight but part from that.\n I just think the flowers are gunna be amazing  when they cover my home.\n Yes yes we'd like to uh uh perhaps you could send some in for us.\n They'll be umbrella sized .\n I I'll remember that thanks very much.\n Thanks for that Lisa . Enjoy your weekend.\n You too bye-bye.\n Sixteen past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden guess what Angus   I have an orchid question for you next.\n\n\n Seventeen past nine and before we find out the orchid question Sally's on a mobile in Nowra. Hello Sally.\n Hi there.\n How are you.\n I'm good thank you  just travelling along.\n Heading south for a holiday.\n Yes  yes having a lovely time.\n Very nice now you've got elephant ears that are suffering.\n Yes look I I seem to manage to get them to grow really really well outside Sydney um and I know that they're meant they like sort of dark moist areas but I was hoping to be able to get a better result um I'm planning on y'know getting them to try and grow them in Sydney and I was just wondering for a bit of advice.\n Elephant ears we're  talking about a a tropical uf sub-tropical sort of plant there and uh what what they need is is warm as possible conditions. So yes they grow very well on place like thr the tropical islands of the pacific and so on so it's about understanding their environment I guess 'n' and giving them what they need. So yeah d deep rich sort of soil uh but a protected position near a uh a brick wall something like that where they can absorb a bit of extra heat in winter uh that'll that'll keep them going quite nicely.\n Okay I'll I'll give it a go if not I suppose a tropical island's in .\n You might just have to move to Fiji \n That'd be fantastic thank you very much.\n Alright that's Angus's advice live in Fiji.\n Well Western Samoa would be my choice.\n Oh would it . Oh \n Good thank you.\n It's an orchid seed pod you need help with.\n Yeah I've got a well I've got quite a few Cymbidium madidums.\n Mhm.\n And I've got with uh several seed pods on it and I was just wondering when they ripen so that I can collect them and then get them uh see if they can I can get them growing.\n Right well they actually change colour as they mature so start off green and they actually sit on the plant for quite a few months while they mature but gradually they will will change to a brownish colour and eventually they'll split open but they're a bit tricky orchid uh growing orchids from seed because they have very minute microscopic seeds that uh unlike most plants theh there's very little food source in the seed and uh normally uh most orchids germinate uh in conjunction with a fungus uh that uh is a a beneficial fungus that that really sorta creates an artificial root system for the orchid while it's getting established so what uh m or professional growers do is is grow them in a sterile nutrient uh environment. So  we call it tissue culture.\n Yeah a nutrie uh a nutrient agar. Yep.\n Yes.\n I understand how they're grown it's it's just when to uh pick them and put them into the paper bags  so like I can um .\n Well normally what uh they do if if you're going to get them tissue cultured is is they harvest them a little bit before they're mature while theh they're still um green but fully uh fully formed so do you have uh have you got a contact in the orchid game that's going to say.\n Oh no I was going to develop that but um   ih I was just wondering what if you can give me a guide on what month like uh.\n Yep. Uh well they're d it generally takes quite a few months for them to mature so probably about four months or so after they form I'm just uh I'm not expert in this area but  it's around about that sort of time so you'll see the pod fully uh swollen uh uh uh when it stops sort of growing in size that's generally an indication that seeds are mature and then as they change colour that they're about to split open and uh. You can try and germinate them uh actually on some peat moss or something like that uh thah obviously that's how they grow in the in the wild uh by just normal germination. Um but but yeah that's uh only.\n So the nutrient uh agar's a a far more productive way of doing it.\n Well it is you just get a much higher percentage and  and uh better success rate. Mhm.\n Okay.\n Good luck with it Danny.\n Thank you.\n Thanks for phoning in the other orchids that I remember growing up with  and they used to be just on the rocks there are the rock orchids which is what Trevor in Carlingford would like to ask about am I right Trevor.\n You certainly are Simon.\n So you've got them or you'd like them.\n Well I've got access to some  I want to grow a whole lot more . A lot lot more . In which case I'd like to grow them from seed.\n Yep yep.\n I want to know what the seed looks like where it is and how do I propagate it.\n For  sure the Sydney rock orchid Dendrobium speciosum.\n That's me animal.\n Yes they're uh they're actually a lithophyte meaning they they.\n No need to be rude.\n They grow in rocks and uh look they're a spring flowering plant and then the pods form on the uh spent flower so again it it takes several months for those pods to mature so you're actually coming into sort of summer autumn when they're maturing. So it's a matter of finding a plant that that has set some seed and again uh the the advice is they're they're very uh the seed is dust-like in character so   commercially they're they're propagated in tissue culture and on that nutrient agar we were just mentioning and uh ih that's one way of doing it uh the other way I suppose would just be to if you've got an appropriate sort of environment um if you've haven't got any natural rocks in the backyard you could you could bring in some large rocks. Uh bearing in mind that uh we don't wanna be plundering the bush for our uh our rock features. But uh if you can locate some some large sized rocks um I guess how they grow naturally is the those dust-like seeds are distributed on the rocks 'n' and uh protected usually in a very protected environment shade from the trees and reasonably constant sort of moisture.\n Yeah I would someone told me to grow moss . On the rock and then put the seed on the moss and I just   I've grown dehn well I've had Dendrobiums growing for years and I've never gr seen anything that w could recognise as a seed that was all.\n Yes yeah well that's uh probably 'cos they're so microscopic you you actually they're they're like specks of dust so you really uh if you get one of the seed pods and uh split it open you'll find it contains tens of thousands of of individual seeds so it's it's really a matter of catching the pod uh as it's ripening and um y you can actually put it into a paper bag and and you collect all that seed.\n In the paper bag and then  what you sprinkle the paper bag over the moss or.\n Yeah well what uh what you could do is get a seed tray put some uh sphagnum moss in that and then uh put the seed much as like is done with ferns spores  where uh yeah you get a seed tray and then put a sheet of glass over the top to to uh keep the humih humidity up while the seeds are germinating. And um yeah that that will give you generally a a higher success rate.\n Well that sounds excellent thank you very much and just as a little aside.\n Yes.\n tree that I got from you at the open day at the tip is now two metres tall.\n Yes.\n And I've just uh repotted thirty cuttings I took off it last year and they're all doing well and I thank you very much.\n Terrific.\n Wow thirty-one trees from thirty threes from one.\n Yeah good value isn't it.\n Yes.\n.\n This is what we like to hear Trevor.\n That's great Trevor.\n See you later.\n Have a great day.\n Cheers.\n Twenty-five past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney.\n\n\n Ah this is seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and very shortly we're also going to find out about Waterfall Cottage Jeanne Villani has been tending this and it's an amazing garden many areas of uh ur set around a creek the waterfall plunges into this beautiful pool and the house and the creek goes down through the property and it's part of the open garden scheme I think for four or five dollars or uh y'know you get to wander around the garden take a picnic 'cos it's enough to do that and also uh see all the water dragons we'll meet Jeanne Villani and give you the address in the next half hour twenty-six minutes past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney a fine sunny day top temperatures on the coast of twenty-seven degrees thirty degrees inland and the outlook for tomorrow fine and sunny with some westerly winds starting ahead of a change and it'll be raining on Monday and Tuesday. Gillian's been waiting very patiently at Wyong Creek how are you Gillian.\n I'm good thanks Simon how are you.\n Very well you wanna propagate a melaleuca.\n Yeah um I've got a question for Angus  um I've tried propagating from my Melaleuca viridiflora a couple of times and um all I seem to get are some dead sticks . And I was hoping Angus might be able to give me a few pointers as to when is the best time to do it.\n Yep.\n Um   the other thing is that the trees I'm propagating from they're not fully matured trees . I don't know if that's got something to do with it or not y'know.\n Oh no that would help if anything uh so have you tried propagating by seed.\n No.\n Because  that's a I think probably the easier option.\n The reason I haven't done that is because I've been told   I don't know if it's true that if I propagate from seed they will revert back to the cream coloured flower not the red flower.\n Okay yep yep sure that  is a possibility.\n I really wanted the red flower.\n Yep yep  okay yes alright yeah cuttings are definitely an option. And what I'd be looking at is is taking cuttings uh at what's called a semi-hardwood stage which is uh ab around about now in fact.\n Mhm.\n So what you're looking for uh are the tips of the branches where the leaves have have started to or well have fully expanded um but the s the stem hasn't gone perhaps as woody as as um  as it will.\n Yep mhm.\n So what uh really ab over the next couple of months is is a good time to be trying uh and I'd be looking at a cutting say about ten to fifteen centimetres long . And removing the bottom uh few leaves  and then uh I'd be trying one of the uh the rooting hormones  that you can get which are um you dip the end of the cutting in a  and uh and then I guess ah just just putting into a a m a relatively sheltered environment if  if you don't have a propagation house.\n No I don't no.\n Yeah yeah um but I find a a sheltered sort of uh deck or something like  that where it's not getting blasting hot sun or wind and that sort of thing  will keep it c uh keep it pretty happy . And uh a good well drained buh you can get specialist propagation mixes based  on coarse sand or perlite that sort of thing.\n And they're alright for natives.\n They're great f yes  perfect for uh for natives.\n Okay.\n And uh yeah that's I think uh will maximise your chances of success.\n Alright well thanks for that advice Angus.\n Yeah.\n I'll give it a go.\n Alright.\n And it it is worth trying from seed though even though you're not  guaranteed.\n Yeah that's true yeah yeah it's worth it. I might get .\n Uh   yes if the plants are growing in isolation uh if you've only got the red flowered form uh and they're pollinating each other then uh there's a very good chance the seed will come true to type.\n Yep okay yeah alright.\n Thanks Gillian.\n Thanks a lot okay bye.\n There we go Gillian and her melaleucas at twenty-nine minutes past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney couple of gardening events from Simone's What's On include the Luddenham Show which is on today and tomorrow it's like the old fashioned show y'know the  produce show bit like Picton Saint Ives those sort of shows. Luddenham Show's today and tomorrow uh at uh corner of Park Road and Campbell Street in Luddenham and also the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show now Angus has been telling me about the Blue Mountains Dahlia Championship and let me tell you that is   a tense event it really is. Um.\n Look there's there's nothing like a cactus dahlia to to really get you.\n Ah mate.\n Get you going.\n And and the amount of work they go through do they still drug test at the uh Dahlia cuh Championship.\n They do  yes yes steroids are a common  issue these days.\n Ih l also be vegetables pot plants floral uh arrangements and all sorts of things that's at the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show it's the seventy-eighth one and I think it's children free three bucks to get in ten till three-thirty uh also another event on today is the Cattai National Park Discovery Walk aln  the Hawkesbury River and along the clifftop Cattai visitors centre and tomorrow the Cumberland State Forest which is a fantastic little oasis in the  heart of the hills   Cumberland State Forest Castle Hill Road West Pennant Hills they're doing a bush tucker walk where the rangers will take you through the bush you'll get to identify edible food and then you'll have a tasting as well I think adults are about three bucks children two bucks but you do need to book and the phone number for that nine-eight-seven-one-double-three-double-seven nine-eight-seven-one-double-three-double-seven and of course our open garden scheme garden which we'll talk about in the next half hour but with a fine day ahead of us let's find out what's happening in news headlines and good morning to John Hall.\n\n\n Thanks for that John and of course after the news at ten the Weekend Woodies resume their do it yourself home renovation and has Les managed to fix the horrible piece of mutilated timber that I gave him last week after I tried to make a shelf we'll find out about that tool of the week and a boofhead as well so that's stay with the weekend show.\n\n\n Right now Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and Colleen's on the line in The Entrance how are you Colleen.\n I'm very well thank you how are you.\n Very well but your agapanthus aren't.\n No very sick  very sick . Yes they've got a white powder sort of stuff all over them and the leaves turn crinkly and yellow and die  and it all goes to sorta jelly.\n Mm.\n Mm.\n Right it sounds they're uh one of the world's toughest um  plants the agapanthus. What sort of conditions is it uh growing in.\n Well they've been there for years doing fine um   they're ou um plenty of light 'n' um just I don't know up the backyard in the garden.\n Yep yep so they're not uh yes I mildew  ih ih so you can rub th off this white  substance.\n And it goes right down into the to the uh centre of the plant.\n Mhm.\n Mm.\n Mkay  so it's not a insect or anything like that.\n No no no no.\n It s it sounds like a fungus yeah. Wuh yeah I've don't I've never struck agapanthus getting a powdery mildew or downy mildew but uh  I I guess it's it's uh it may be possible uh I guess fungicide would be uh indicated if if it is a fungus.\n Yeah.\n Um so.\n is it.\n I guess yeah without seeing it I I c I'd be inclined to recommend that you take a sample along to to your local garden centre 'n'.\n Yeah I I did think that yes.\n And get them to have a look at it  and um ih if they've got a good horticulturalist there they'll be able tell you whether it's fungal and and um recommend a a suitable fungicide. Uh if it is powdery mildew something like one of the sulfur based fungicides would would be uh indicated . But uh I'd I.\n And also with the local ones they'd know what was happening in the area too wouldn't they.\n Yes yeah but it's.\n Yes and I've got a good one at over at Ourimbah a big t  All Seasons nursery over there I think I'll take one s plants over there might be me b best shot.\n Would be a good idea I think  to get a a a visual ala .\n And they don't mind if you walk in  and say can I h can I have the orh the y'know the horticulturalists they sort of.\n I'm sure they'd be.\n They'd be happy to do that.\n Yes.\n Amenable but uh.\n In the yeah.\n Yeah.\n. It's worth a try because I've a loh I've got a lot of agapanthus.\n Yes it's unusual to to um hear of them having problems like that are they uh have they been divided up.\n No not recently no .\n 'Cos that can sometimes be a an issue with clumping plants like that as they get older uh the the clumps tend to sort of ih.\n W what's happened is some of the seeds have come off 'n' and um y'know grown again and even the younger plants have got it.\n Mhm mhm.\n As well as the older ones mm.\n Yeah but if the clump is very sort of tight uh sometimes dividing in them up can reinvigorate them 'n' and uh so if you dig up an old clump and and just uh uh split it gih give it a bit more sort of room to move  uh it starts to grow vigorously again and uh with something like agapanthus I would think it would would would be able to grow through a problem like that . So that I would suggest be another strategy you could employ.\n Okay then well uh  try all those and see what happens.\n Yeah.\n Alright Colleen.\n Okay then good thanks very much.\n Good luck  twenty-four minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney.\n\n\n Two incidents causing problems today uh are at the moment there is an accident involving a car and a truck at Lane Cove West that's on Epping Road at Mowbray Road one of three westbound lanes are closed with moderate delays there and also Lidcombe Parramatta Road between Hill Road and Birnie Avenue. One of two eastbound lanes closed uh not as sh many delays there but eastbound traffic affected by that one twenty-three minutes away from ten.\n\n\n We've just had somebody ring in to say that uh it could be mealy bug on the agapanthus.\n Wh mealy uh I mean I did did uh ask Colleen about insects uh mealy bug can actually look like uh a fungus uh because it it has that sorta white uh cottony appearance. So that's why I think it'd be good idea to get a a second opinion at a g uh someone who can look at .\n Hop along to the horticulturalist at the garden centre.\n Yeah yes if it is mealy bug then uh obviously it will need an entirely different treatment to a uh fungicide. It'll need an insecticide uh or you can wipe wipe them off and uh go down that road uh but uh it's it's a very nasty problem the mealy bug one and I'd be seeking help.\n\n\n Very shortly Jeanne Villani to talk about her open garden but first of all on the line is uh Lynne in Engadine how are you Lynne.\n\n\n Ah Lynne's playing the piano. Hang on .\n\n\n Yeah no that's very good Lynne . Isn't that nice.\n Is that Rachmaninoff.\n Ah it's rack something off but there we go at twenty-two minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Bernie's on the line in Crow's Nest Bernie can you play the piano for us as well.\n Uh no I can't  my little boy can.\n Oh can he.\n Yeah .\n It's alright honestly . You wanna r move a satin ash.\n Yeah a Windsor satin ash  Syzygium dansiei.\n Mhm.\n Just uh it's about one and a half metres high.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Um it's been planted for about eighteen months just wanting to know if it's okay to to move it.\n Well they can be a bit tricky. Uh wuh uh I mean any evergreen plant that that is getting to that sort of size but look uh yes Syzygiums or lilly pillies are one of the more amenable plants to   to being pruned and then uh regrowing and and I think that's the key to transplanting uh evergreen plants when they uh the the biggest problem with them is water stress so if they've got a lot of uh leafy growth as lilly pillies tend to do then it creates a lot of water stress on the plant if you damage the root system when you move it. So what I would suggest is if you have no option but to move it is to to trim it back by about a third  and uh obviously take as big a root ball as possible but but uh giving it maximum protection when it's uh been moved. There are some commercial products that that you can spray onto the leaves to to limit the water loss um and uh really waiting until the weather cools down as well and the plant goes into a sort of a a uh semi-dormancy . Uh all those things will will maximise your chances of success  and it it should be possible a metre and a half it it's getting to the limit of uh where it's a a feasible idea but uh I think it's definitely not impossible.\n Yep yep.\n Mm.\n Righto.\n Alright thank you very much.\n Thanks Bernie.\n Righto.\n Let's see if Lynne's still playing the piano.\n\n\n That's beautiful isn't it.\n It is.\n Who would think Saturday morning's the best time just to sit listen to the radio   play a little bit of piano.\n Perhaps she's . Perhaps she's playing it to her um to her plant.\n Well she's got a cycad that's giving birth so maybe she's just playing the cycad soothing music in the nursery.\n Indeed.\n Good on you Lynne.\n Perhaps it's still in the maternity ward.\n Uh that could well be the question uh uh William's on the line in Artarmon hello William.\n G'day Simon how are you.\n Very well.\n The shot. My question relates to mwah to tomatoes and rhubarb.\n Right.\n Last year we had a terrific crop of rhuba of uh tomatoes . And uh this year some wild tomato bushes have come up in the compost as a result of the compost . In the interim we planted nine um bushes of rhubarb . We had two uh meals off them . And now six of them have died is there any uh opposition to growing op uh rhubarb near tomatoes.\n Will tomatoes pick on rhubarb .\n Oh I wouldn't have thought so the the sort of issues uh you're looking at with uh vegetables are uh it's crop rotation plants of the same family do tend to get similar diseases so y'know tomatoes and capsicums things like that they're  very closely related.\n I see mm.\n But uh tomatoes and rhubarb are that's they're a long way apart botanically so I wouldn't think there would be any link between.\n Want to give the game away if I can't grow rhubarb.\n Well it's a c could be a number of of factors. Ih uh.\n I know that from the provedores the fruit and veg guy the two things that have been causing problems this year have been rhubarb and tomatoes for the uh  commercial growers.\n Go on go on.\n So the wet weather the heat the wet weather the heat  have caused problems for particularly roma and those sort of  tomatoes . And uh rhubarb's been tricky as well.\n Ours apollo tomatoes and they've been a terrific crop but we just had to change them to another bed this year.\n Right.\n Yes yeah.\n mm.\n Yes you've done the the right things there but certainly the the sort of conditions that that Simon's describing uh we've had in Sydney as well and ih it it does tend to predispose plants to root rots.\n Uh would you suggest uh replanting rhubarb with new crop new.\n Yes but doing it in a different spot.\n In a different spot.\n Yes yeah.\n Okay  right.\n Good on you William nothing like fresh rhubarb is there.\n Enjoy your program.\n Thanks for being on it.\n Good on you mate.\n It is seventeen from ten a little musical interlude from Lynne.\n\n\n It's beautiful .\n\n\n No one's ever done that to me before rung up and played the piano to me.\n Yes.\n I feel I feel pressured uh precious and treasured.\n What about her cycad. This must get.\n Well the cycad  very peaceful. Let's.\n Twenty-four hours a day by the.\n Open the playschool window and see who's got their open garden this weekend.\n\n\n Jeanne Villani you play the piano as well don't you.\n No I don't I don't have time I'm too busy gardening.\n I know 'cos the uh the size of of Waterfall Cottage how big's the actual garden.\n Uh oh probably   three acres I would think of the eight acres the property. It it's hard to know because it sort of one blends into the other.\n And it's in Bayview you get a lot of the sort of the the protection and rainforest around there from this beautiful gully isn't it.\n Yes yes it's um sort of a bit cooler down here than it is in the outside world.\n The uh there's several different rooms we follow the gully down but you've got areas going off with a dovecot and palms and that sort of thing describe if I was to walk around the garden what would I see.\n Well at the moment you'd see a lot of purple plectranthus because um it's a   it's a it's a plant that's very hard to uh sorry very easy to uh take cuttings from and uh so I've got a lot of it and it looks absolutely wonderful there's just big purple drifts. The other thing that's uh looking particularly good at the moment is uh are the gingers and the bat plant's in flower.\n Oh the bat plants are spectacular.\n Yes. Yes and all the rainforest trees are now growing th that I planted to extend the rainflorist  forest belt. Um to protect the house um. Should the fires come . Um   they're all growing now so uh yes they're all different sort of areas.\n You've retained a lot of the natural uh vegetation there too Jeanne  haven't you.\n Yes yes there's a lot of uh large rainforest trees and then it uh goes off into the bush and uh   plus the wildlife so uh.\n The wildlife you mean the water dragons.\n Well no uh  they're they're no trouble because they eat the slugs and snails they're wonderful but uh   once the drought was over the wallabies weren't so bad eating all the uh all the buds on plants but uh now there's a family of brush turkeys have moved in and they're uh relocating the mulch and uh  and some of the plants too while the uh while they're about it.\n Have you got any tips on dealing with a uh malicious brush turkey  Jeanne.\n Ooh basting in a slow oven for four hours isn't it.\n They they look as though they'd be a bit tough.\n Now also around there are lots of ponds and indeed is the waterfall running.\n Uh no it's stopped uh again because it hasn't rained since uh oh which was the day when we had all the heavy rain Wednesday I think . And it hasn't rained since then and it goes underground but um   uh further down the creek it's running but it actually over the edge of the waterfall ih it isn't running at the moment unfortunately.\n Now I believe also that somebody works very hard cuh making all sorts of beautiful comestibles and teas.\n Mm  yeah they're all ready all I've gotta do is uh cut up the cake and uh we're ready to go.\n And what is Jeanne's cake this weekend.\n Oh well it's lemon muffins and brownies and carrot cake.\n Oh yum.\n And have you got any lemon myrtle tea to go with it Jeanne.\n No lemon and ginger tea .\n Terrific or you need  some of those um.\n I could go and pick some lemon myrtle leaves and uh.\n You've got a lemon myrtle bush there.\n Oh yes yeah.\n So people can have a look at that as well I always get the address wrong so give us to us again.\n Ninety.\n Yep.\n Cabbage Tree Road Bayview.\n Ninety Cabbage Tree Road Bayview which of course is on the northern beaches.\n Yes.\n Turn left at um   Avalon. Am I right.\n No no no no no.\n No.\n No  um if you're coming down Mona Vale Road you turn left before you get into Mona Vale.\n That's right.\n Yeah.\n Yes uh.\n No no don't go as far as Avalon  unless you're coming from Palm Beach .\n That's right . So turn left at Mona Vale and it's ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview today and tomorrow Jeanne.\n That's right yeah.\n And from oh in about twelve minutes time.\n Yes ten till four-thirty.\n We'll let you get into it and w how much are you charging for to go in.\n Uh five dollars fifty for adults and children are free.\n And uh bring in uh suh uh suh a blanket to sit on 'cos it's a beautiful big garden. Have a great weekend.\n Well there are lots of seats.\n Lots of seats.\n Yes  they don't have to sit on the ground.\n Alright Jeanne have a great weekend.\n Good thanks Simon.\n There we go Jeanne Villani there and the address is ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and a most impressive garden and uh you can see the lemon myrtle and maybe see the brush turkeys as well twelve minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney the Weekend Show Angus there taking your calls and if you'd like to ask a question for the Woodies they're along after ten o'clock as well.\n\n\n Now uh let's just   hear a little bit no it's not there anymore let's see whether uh Beth wants to take Lynne's place do you Beth.\n I do indeed thank you so much .\n Playing piano or um.\n Definitely not no no.\n You've got a cycad question.\n I have a cycad question I hope it's the same question as  as the other lady's and it helps her out too. I had a magnificent old cycad  that has been in my care for about fifteen years and um it appeared to go to cycad heaven. And it was it's in a pot  and I simply left it and um   when it's rained it's rained and uh it's probably been I thought dead but we'll say dormant for  at least twelve months . And in the last month or so it's had um a number of little cycads appear all around the edge of it . A mass masses of them . My question is um it's in a pot there's not there's really not very much room around those edges . Are these   little ones are they independent plants and can I separate them or are they part of the assumed deceased cycad.\n Uh yes  yeah.\n Can I separate them can I do something 'cos they will not last in the pot the way they are.\n Yes you can they are uh little vegetative um buds that are sprouting at the base there sometimes called pups  and uh yes yeah they c they will uh gradually develop a an independent or root system of their own  which enables you to to split them off and pot them up.\n Right.\n So  when do you know is the right time to do that Angus.\n Well it's uh I'd I'd wait for the sorta cooler weather but but also you'll see uh if you dig actually try 'n' uh uh lift one out whether it's it's got a bit of a a root system at the base.\n Right.\n So I'd be guided by the the plants themselves  just uh there's a a lot of them you might just have a scratch around one 'n' 'n' see when it's uh starting to develop a r a reasonable little root system of its own.\n Okay well there certainly are a lot of them .  I've I thought it was my my personal backyard phoenix.\n Ah.\n. It sounds like it.\n Oh it's been it's been a nice surprise.\n Yeah.\n I was pretty ashamed of myself letting it die .\n Well there you haven't let it die. Obviously  if you've um you've nurtured it um.\n It's come back alright.\n Uh what sort of music have you been playing it just out of interest  to get that sort of result.\n Uh it gets the regular sounds of dogs barking and chooks cackling.\n Oh  yeah well maybe piano'll help .\n I thought  a bit of A C D C but it'd have to be.\n A C D C for the cycads .\n Bon Scott variety .\n Can ih can I ask one other very quick question.\n Yep.\n At what point is it too late to try to transplant a potted citrus. Where do you give up and just go buy a new one.\n Well   I think that this is true of all woody plants they they can get root-bound  and and that's the uh the biggest issue. So really I'd I'd be guided by the the appearance of the root system. When you take it outta the pot if you see a lotta roots curling around the bottom uh really to me to get a decent sort of citrus tree y you're going to have to perform drastic surgery to cut off all of those um sorta curled roots  and uh prune the top of the plant to to compensate for that  uh you you can resuscitate them and uh I would say it's a kill or cure sort of  situation  and if you kill it well  g that's the time to go and buy an other one but.\n But it.\n It's sad already so.\n They are very resilient uh plants though  citrus uh but if you do sort of go down that route of uh the drastic prune of the roots and the top uh watch out for suckers coming from the rootstock  uh at the base of the plant it'll sometimes induce those and you've just gotta uh knock those off with  your fingers.\n Mhm.\n But it it would be worth a try I would say to r to resuscitate it  but um.\n Again leave it leave it until a bit later on in the year.\n Yes yeah I'd autumn really is  the perfect time.\n Okay terrific.\n Yeah.\n Alright.\n Got a few tasks to do thank you so much.\n Good on you  Beth bye-bye.\n Let's see what uh Lynne's playing nowadays.\n.\n Ah you're not playing the piano anymore.\n Oh Simon look I'm sorry .\n Don't be sorry it was it was a lovely interlude. You've  obviously practised that tune for a while.\n I know you're culturally appreciative so I thought that might've been nice little interlude sorry about that my bad manners.\n It was b  but I think we might have answered your cycad question.\n Well mine's just it's about thirty years old and it's huge about nearly a metre and a half high  and all of a sudden we've got a baby at the bottom of it.\n Mhm.\n A pup.\n Yes.\n That's what they're called.\n A pup.\n A pup.\n A pup of cycad.\n There we go.\n Okay so what what do I do.\n Yeah uh well I think just just wait to to the for the cooler weather and and you can actually just excise that from the plant . Uh provided it's got a a few new little roots of its own  and pot it up into a uh and put it in a protected sorta position and uh with a bit of luck it it will just uh grow into a it's own independent plant.\n Good.\n And the music  that Lynne should play to it you say A C D C.\n Well I've always had good success with with uh the Bon Scott A C D C type but obviously piano is is good too.\n Working a treat . Good on you Lynne.\n It's  underrated I think music and  plants.\n Bye.\n Six minutes away from ten which means it's uh less than uh ten minutes away from the Woodies and on the line we have Jack in Concord how are you Jack.\n Uh good morning. Uh look I have um about sixteen golden diosma.\n Yep.\n They're the dwarf ones.\n Yes.\n And they've been here for about two years  and they've been going quite well . But in the last say two months I've lost three of them . They've just uh dried up uh or  or something's happened to them and they're just dying.\n Okay so you seeing anything on the tops that   insect damage or fungal growth anything like that.\n No there doesn't seem to be anything wrong they were  going quite well . And then all of a sudden they just started to go brown . Uh lost their uh green and they've just dried up.\n Mm mm or lost their gold in this case.\n Yes.\n Uh but look there's a couple of possibilities I can think of. The golden diosma ih it actually belongs to the citrus family believe it or not um Rutaceae  and uh they can be a little bit susceptible to to rootrots uh and the weather we've been having would would uh with the humidity and so on would uh perhaps predispose the plants to something like phytophthora or rhizoctania one of the fungal root rots  uh so you could try something like uh Anti Rot on the plants that are are remaining to boost their sort of immunity to root rots if that's what it is but what I would be doing is is pulling up the the dead ones  and having a a look at their root systems uh because the other thing that's starting to uh come into play at the moment is uh curl grub uh curl grubs the larvae of the uh African black beetles.\n A few people weeding go isn't that cute I've got a witchetty grub in my garden but it's not is it.\n No they're well usually they're they're uh curl grubs or something similar which are feeding on the root system. And uh that can uh damage the plant in itself and it can also provide an entry site for these rootrots so I'd be digging up the dead ones and and having a look at their root systems if you can find any of those curl grubs you'll uh might need to take preventative action to to save the other  fifteen  golden diosmas.\n How do you get rid of the uh curl grub.\n Well there are various chemical treatments you can use um I guess that's probably the there is uh also a uh a nematode beneficial nematode that is available   for home gardeners that you can water in it's a microscopic eelworm they're called but they they can actually get into the curl grub and and uh kill it uh uh in a a more natural sorta fashion.\n Yes well where they're growing uh like uh I had a natural garden along but  I dug those up and uh we had a lot of um oxalis growing . Now I had to get rid of that  so I sprayed it with um Roundup  nuh and then I covered it with um ah   uh uh um.\n Mulch.\n Gra brah uh grass mat . And then put pebbles on top . And uh but they've been going quite well up till uh and these three are all together.\n Yes.\n G y'know all the rest are good.\n Yep yep m well again that would tn tend to suggest something attacking the roots they couldn't have got a a whiff of the herbicide could they.\n Well I don't think so I I made   ev uh uh very sure about putting this Roundup on  I rung up their information bureau and they said it wouldn't hurt the uh soil at all  uh that's what their  uh reasoning was . So I just put the w I waited for a good few weeks  and uh y'know before I planted them.\n Yes no should be okay yes I'd I'd be looking at the the curl grubs and the the root rot question.\n Alrightio.\n Yes I'll do that and find that out.\n Okay  good luck Jack.\n Ah and there was one other thing.\n Ooh we're outta time Jack 'cos the news is breathing down on us I might  get you to hold the line and if Angus is feeling in a good mood he might chat to you during the news. Can you hold on.\n Okay yeah.\n There we go and also Wally in coh in Neutral Bay hold the line we'll uh get you to the news time I'm just wanting to let you know that the address for the open garden scheme today Cabbage Tree uh Waterfall Cottage is ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and uh that's right near Mona Vale on the northern beaches ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and Angus we'll see you in five weeks time I think on your home turf.\n Mm.\n I might be broadcasting from the studios of ninety-two-point-five in Erina so uh we'll see you up on the coast .\n On my own dung hill  say.\n And uh luke look forward to using the compost toilet or something like that.\n Well I'll bring in some uh some worm uh droppings for you.\n What are the  things we put in worm farms apart from garden kitchen waste I've put in torn up cardboard.\n Yes uh straw  uh just sort of old old uh lawn clippings that have dried out  that sort of thing will will open it out and get some oxygen in to to help the worms along.\n Oh that's what I need to do is to help the worms. The Weekend Woodies are up next speaking of worms and they'll be taking your calls on anything round the house that's causing problems and of course in Saturday Talkabout Tony Delroy is joined by Leo Compton and Jen Fleming to look back at the week on the wireless a fine day today top temperature on the coast of twenty-seven degrees thirty degrees inland but right now on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney it's news time ten o'clock.\n"]

    ' Thanks for that John Hall now John Hall will be listening for the next hour cos Angus Stewart is here to take your calls eighttriplethreeonethousand oneeighthundredeighthundredsevenohtwo something in the garden thats causing you problems give us a call right now and Angus can I mean yknow he is known in the trade as Mr popergation  Mr propagation Hes also known for his passion for natives and his love of o orchids am I right so far  I guess yeah yeah   Hes also known  for his ability to open cosposting  toilets so he can tell you anything worm farm problems certainly helped us and although Im still confused about dry ingredients we might talk about that as well but eighttriplethreeonethousand oneeighthundredeighthundredsevenohtwo fine sunny day today top temperatures on the coast of twentyseven inland thirty degrees Bowral enjoying twentyseven and Katoomba twentyfive degrees currently around town on the coast its seventeen thats four below   r Richmond and Bankstown are fifteen degrees Penrith sixteen Katoomba thirteen and Gosford twelve One of the jewels in the open garden scheme crown is opening today and this is just a garden to envy how would you like   to have   a beautiful sandstone cottage nestled underneath a waterfall with a little pond and then a creek that runs through with thousands of water dragons so tame they come up and just   kiss you Would you like to live there  Okay  Jeanne Villani does and well find out the secret of her open garden and give you the address so that you can go along today and tomorrow to see Waterfall Cottage which is a part of the open garden scheme all this and more because it is Saturday    Eighttriplethreeonethousand oneeighthundredeighthundredsevenohtwo Suzannes on the line in McMahons Point and  Hello  How are you  Im good thank you  Youve got a big fat  Morton Bay fig  Well its not that bit its um its about three feet cos I only know feet  About three feet high and um its been doing so well my partner actually grew it from a seed we picked it up in a church garden  and our intention was to buy a house and plant it but we havent got the house yet So weve still got the fig and its doing so well until recently My um I think its under stress God knows why  its only on a balcony in a pot but its getting a sort first of all I thought it was sunburn but the the leaves are getting oh um a pale ring and then after a while they crack  And   and then they break off first of all I thought oh golly its a bug or something eating it But no it seems to be happening as theyre growing theyre perfectly fine and then intermittently they get this its its as if somebody has um um put some hydrogen peroxide on them or something and then  Is there plenty of drainage in the pot  Yes uhuh um plenty Im just wondering well obviously its gotta come out of the pot and be planted in   a proper place but  You think its a case of Free Willy it wants to just go into the  into the open  It does cos its meant  I dont know Angus is that the case  Well the symptoms you describe um it it sounds could it possibly be water stress Do you think the plant could be drying out from time to time  Yeah well it could be maybe Im not giving it enough  Yeah they uh I mean they are a a rainforest tree that thats used to fairly constant moisture and and mulch yknow plenty of leaf mulch uh froh in the natural sort of environment um  Should I feed it some more Ih feed it   Well I dont I wouldnt be so concerned about the feeding uh I mean what what youre in really is a sort of a holding operation  Yes that was the idea  So I think uh if you encourage more growth uh the plants going to become uh more and more pot bound  Suh so I would be thinking about putting it into a uh a slightly larger container and just gradually moving it up a a container size every year  Which I we have been doing its about   oh it would be about three and a half years old now  And uh God knows how were going to get it out of this pot  Um I it reminds me of what happens to a gardenia when it hasnt got  when you need to give it Epsom salts  Right  Thats thats the sort of thing that seems to be happening with it W would it  So its sort of a yellowing of the   the foliage gradually  Yes only in a certain area and then that uh pale part breaks  Right yeah yep is it in the older foliage that youre noticing that Or the new growth  Wih uh no um   yes it is well it is in the older foliage but  I notice that with the new growth   its starting to happen too  Yes well it yeah cih t obviously the a lack of nutrients would tend to make it pale off a bit but uh  uh perhaps you could just give it the occasional liquid feed Uh one of the sorta complete liquid feeds that are on the market you can water that over the foliage and it will sorta feed those leaves n n keep them healthy  and I think just uh repotting it uh every year as youve been doing giving it a l bit more space um thats the way to go and theyre pretty tough plants too so  Id hate to be be responsible for anything bad happening to it  Yeah  So maybe I should find a park somewhere  Well thats thats yeah  they do need a lotta space  a park is a good option so  Mm mm  Well good luck with Suzanne  Okay thank you very much Simon love your show  Thanks for being on it  Thank you bye  The perplexing Morton Bay fig problem they are beautiful trees though how long do they take the ones that we see round town that are humungous  Mm  How long how old would they be roughly  Well youre looking at hundred  years plus those huge buttress roots and that kind of thing ih theyre just uh extraordinary  And weve come to understand now that we should have lots of h h not hummus or tabouli but humus underneath the roots and uh those  uh the beautiful air breathing s almost  aerial roots  Thats what they are exactly theyre theyre sort of support roots but they do like very well aerated conditions so grow them in a pot is quite feasible but uh they do like that constant moisture th that is provided by the humus that you mentioned Simon  And what about the um you know the the not ikebana the the the  bonsaiing them can you bonsai them  Ah yes they make  fabulous bonsais  Maybe that would be Suzannes option is to bonsai it  Well I c could be s recommended thats for sure  McMahons Point shes right near North Sydney library she could wander up there and uh have a get a bonsai book out n have her   portable   Morton Bay fig  I love it Good bonsai with a bit of suiseki around the base  And a touch of wasabi bit of soya sauce  tastes beautiful    Ah Lisas on the line in Cammeray youve got mutant gardenias from another planet Lisa  I have Simon good morning Um I have some potted gardenias um which Ive had for a while they we went away they dried out they were almost dead and I thought   trying to resurrect them I just cut them back until I found green  Mm  Theyve grown back Beautifully  Good on you  But some of the leaves are enormous theyre like sixteen centimetres long  Yes  Um but then others are normal size   Mm  Sixteen centimetres  Sixteen  its true I had a witness yesterday we measured it just to make sure I wasnt going completely mad um but yes  I dont know why  Is it growing a little sort of like whip spike out of the centre and feet from the side  No no triffid um  attributes or anything it is just the the I mean the leaves I mean its been attacked by a by a caterpillar as well which Ive managed to pick off most of those and Ive got those under control but the  new leaf growth is just amazing its glossy theres nothing wrong with it it uh  I mean its just sprouting everywhere but some of the leaves are just huge  Is that normal  for a gardenia Angus  Well I wouldnt say normal it uh but it plants will respond to to environmental conditions so it sounds like its been on a very good paddock  If I could say that youve been uh obviously feeding it uh quite well by the sound of things  Well  look let me put it this way uh my green thumb is sort of uh more like a green fingertip  Im not exactly um yknow terrific  in the garden Im like I put in an effort  but I I just gave uh look I did um to resurrect them a little bit I put some Seasol on them to  to try and get ev yknow remuh mulch the soil that sort of thing  get them back on track and then a slow r release fertiliser buh buh but that was about it  Well thats uh thats the idea though with those slow release fertilisers theyre  they the nutrients are always there for the plant and its uh   yeah its literally on a very good paddock uh but also light conditions can play a part as well um leaves will will respond to the environment and if theres a lower light level they can enlarge and and become a a darker green because theres more chlorophyll to catch the available light  that sort of thing So is it in a shadier usually  Well actually I uh I h I have to really keep the water up to them because they it gets sun most of the time  but then by afternoon um weve got a sort of a m a mirella um sorta planted not far from it I think it shadows the plant significantly in the afternoon I dont know if  if that makes a difference I mean like  Well it will  Yeah  Yeah I would suggest uh s the leaves are just uh trying to catch as much light as possible   um so I yeah I dont think its anything to worry about sounds to me like uh Its saying thank you  Its saying thank you  Im just   Might need to get it a personal trainer and wear off a bit  of that weight but part from that  I just think the flowers are gunna be amazing  when they cover my home  Yes yes wed like to uh uh perhaps you could send some in for us  Theyll be umbrella sized   I Ill remember that thanks very much  Thanks for that Lisa  Enjoy your weekend  You too byebye  Sixteen past nine on sevenohtwo A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden guess what Angus   I have an orchid question for you next    Seventeen past nine and before we find out the orchid question Sallys on a mobile in Nowra Hello Sally  Hi there  How are you  Im good thank you  just travelling along  Heading south for a holiday  Yes  yes having a lovely time  Very nice now youve got elephant ears that are suffering  Yes look I I seem to manage to get them to grow really really well outside Sydney um and I know that theyre meant they like sort of dark moist areas but I was hoping to be able to get a better result um Im planning on yknow getting them to try and grow them in Sydney and I was just wondering for a bit of advice  Elephant ears were  talking about a a tropical uf subtropical sort of plant there and uh what what they need is is warm as possible conditions So yes they grow very well on place like thr the tropical islands of the pacific and so on so its about understanding their environment I guess n and giving them what they need So yeah d deep rich sort of soil uh but a protected position near a uh a brick wall something like that where they can absorb a bit of extra heat in winter uh thatll thatll keep them going quite nicely  Okay Ill Ill give it a go if not I suppose a tropical islands in   You might just have to move to Fiji   Thatd be fantastic thank you very much  Alright thats Anguss advice live in Fiji  Well Western Samoa would be my choice  Oh would it  Oh   Good thank you  Its an orchid seed pod you need help with  Yeah Ive got a well Ive got quite a few Cymbidium madidums  Mhm  And Ive got with uh several seed pods on it and I was just wondering when they ripen so that I can collect them and then get them uh see if they can I can get them growing  Right well they actually change colour as they mature so start off green and they actually sit on the plant for quite a few months while they mature but gradually they will will change to a brownish colour and eventually theyll split open but theyre a bit tricky orchid uh growing orchids from seed because they have very minute microscopic seeds that uh unlike most plants theh theres very little food source in the seed and uh normally uh most orchids germinate uh in conjunction with a fungus uh that uh is a a beneficial fungus that that really sorta creates an artificial root system for the orchid while its getting established so what uh m or professional growers do is is grow them in a sterile nutrient uh environment So  we call it tissue culture  Yeah a nutrie uh a nutrient agar Yep  Yes  I understand how theyre grown its its just when to uh pick them and put them into the paper bags  so like I can um   Well normally what uh they do if if youre going to get them tissue cultured is is they harvest them a little bit before theyre mature while theh theyre still um green but fully uh fully formed so do you have uh have you got a contact in the orchid game thats going to say  Oh no I was going to develop that but um   ih I was just wondering what if you can give me a guide on what month like uh  Yep Uh well theyre d it generally takes quite a few months for them to mature so probably about four months or so after they form Im just uh Im not expert in this area but  its around about that sort of time so youll see the pod fully uh swollen uh uh uh when it stops sort of growing in size thats generally an indication that seeds are mature and then as they change colour that theyre about to split open and uh You can try and germinate them uh actually on some peat moss or something like that uh thah obviously thats how they grow in the in the wild uh by just normal germination Um but but yeah thats uh only  So the nutrient uh agars a a far more productive way of doing it  Well it is you just get a much higher percentage and  and uh better success rate Mhm  Okay  Good luck with it Danny  Thank you  Thanks for phoning in the other orchids that I remember growing up with  and they used to be just on the rocks there are the rock orchids which is what Trevor in Carlingford would like to ask about am I right Trevor  You certainly are Simon  So youve got them or youd like them  Well Ive got access to some  I want to grow a whole lot more  A lot lot more  In which case Id like to grow them from seed  Yep yep  I want to know what the seed looks like where it is and how do I propagate it  For  sure the Sydney rock orchid Dendrobium speciosum  Thats me animal  Yes theyre uh theyre actually a lithophyte meaning they they  No need to be rude  They grow in rocks and uh look theyre a spring flowering plant and then the pods form on the uh spent flower so again it it takes several months for those pods to mature so youre actually coming into sort of summer autumn when theyre maturing So its a matter of finding a plant that that has set some seed and again uh the the advice is theyre theyre very uh the seed is dustlike in character so   commercially theyre theyre propagated in tissue culture and on that nutrient agar we were just mentioning and uh ih thats one way of doing it uh the other way I suppose would just be to if youve got an appropriate sort of environment um if youve havent got any natural rocks in the backyard you could you could bring in some large rocks Uh bearing in mind that uh we dont wanna be plundering the bush for our uh our rock features But uh if you can locate some some large sized rocks um I guess how they grow naturally is the those dustlike seeds are distributed on the rocks n and uh protected usually in a very protected environment shade from the trees and reasonably constant sort of moisture  Yeah I would someone told me to grow moss  On the rock and then put the seed on the moss and I just   Ive grown dehn well Ive had Dendrobiums growing for years and Ive never gr seen anything that w could recognise as a seed that was all  Yes yeah well thats uh probably cos theyre so microscopic you you actually theyre theyre like specks of dust so you really uh if you get one of the seed pods and uh split it open youll find it contains tens of thousands of of individual seeds so its its really a matter of catching the pod uh as its ripening and um y you can actually put it into a paper bag and and you collect all that seed  In the paper bag and then  what you sprinkle the paper bag over the moss or  Yeah well what uh what you could do is get a seed tray put some uh sphagnum moss in that and then uh put the seed much as like is done with ferns spores  where uh yeah you get a seed tray and then put a sheet of glass over the top to to uh keep the humih humidity up while the seeds are germinating And um yeah that that will give you generally a a higher success rate  Well that sounds excellent thank you very much and just as a little aside  Yes  tree that I got from you at the open day at the tip is now two metres tall  Yes  And Ive just uh repotted thirty cuttings I took off it last year and theyre all doing well and I thank you very much  Terrific  Wow thirtyone trees from thirty threes from one  Yeah good value isnt it  Yes   This is what we like to hear Trevor  Thats great Trevor  See you later  Have a great day  Cheers  Twentyfive past nine on sevenohtwo A B C Sydney    Ah this is sevenohtwo A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and very shortly were also going to find out about Waterfall Cottage Jeanne Villani has been tending this and its an amazing garden many areas of uh ur set around a creek the waterfall plunges into this beautiful pool and the house and the creek goes down through the property and its part of the open garden scheme I think for four or five dollars or uh yknow you get to wander around the garden take a picnic cos its enough to do that and also uh see all the water dragons well meet Jeanne Villani and give you the address in the next half hour twentysix minutes past nine on sevenohtwo A B C Sydney a fine sunny day top temperatures on the coast of twentyseven degrees thirty degrees inland and the outlook for tomorrow fine and sunny with some westerly winds starting ahead of a change and itll be raining on Monday and Tuesday Gillians been waiting very patiently at Wyong Creek how are you Gillian  Im good thanks Simon how are you  Very well you wanna propagate a melaleuca  Yeah um Ive got a question for Angus  um Ive tried propagating from my Melaleuca viridiflora a couple of times and um all I seem to get are some dead sticks  And I was hoping Angus might be able to give me a few pointers as to when is the best time to do it  Yep  Um   the other thing is that the trees Im propagating from theyre not fully matured trees  I dont know if thats got something to do with it or not yknow  Oh no that would help if anything uh so have you tried propagating by seed  No  Because  thats a I think probably the easier option  The reason I havent done that is because Ive been told   I dont know if its true that if I propagate from seed they will revert back to the cream coloured flower not the red flower  Okay yep yep sure that  is a possibility  I really wanted the red flower  Yep yep  okay yes alright yeah cuttings are definitely an option And what Id be looking at is is taking cuttings uh at whats called a semihardwood stage which is uh ab around about now in fact  Mhm  So what youre looking for uh are the tips of the branches where the leaves have have started to or well have fully expanded um but the s the stem hasnt gone perhaps as woody as as um  as it will  Yep mhm  So what uh really ab over the next couple of months is is a good time to be trying uh and Id be looking at a cutting say about ten to fifteen centimetres long  And removing the bottom uh few leaves  and then uh Id be trying one of the uh the rooting hormones  that you can get which are um you dip the end of the cutting in a  and uh and then I guess ah just just putting into a a m a relatively sheltered environment if  if you dont have a propagation house  No I dont no  Yeah yeah um but I find a a sheltered sort of uh deck or something like  that where its not getting blasting hot sun or wind and that sort of thing  will keep it c uh keep it pretty happy  And uh a good well drained buh you can get specialist propagation mixes based  on coarse sand or perlite that sort of thing  And theyre alright for natives  Theyre great f yes  perfect for uh for natives  Okay  And uh yeah thats I think uh will maximise your chances of success  Alright well thanks for that advice Angus  Yeah  Ill give it a go  Alright  And it it is worth trying from seed though even though youre not  guaranteed  Yeah thats true yeah yeah its worth it I might get   Uh   yes if the plants are growing in isolation uh if youve only got the red flowered form uh and theyre pollinating each other then uh theres a very good chance the seed will come true to type  Yep okay yeah alright  Thanks Gillian  Thanks a lot okay bye  There we go Gillian and her melaleucas at twentynine minutes past nine on sevenohtwo A B C Sydney couple of gardening events from Simones Whats On include the Luddenham Show which is on today and tomorrow its like the old fashioned show yknow the  produce show bit like Picton Saint Ives those sort of shows Luddenham Shows today and tomorrow uh at uh corner of Park Road and Campbell Street in Luddenham and also the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show now Angus has been telling me about the Blue Mountains Dahlia Championship and let me tell you that is   a tense event it really is Um  Look theres theres nothing like a cactus dahlia to to really get you  Ah mate  Get you going  And and the amount of work they go through do they still drug test at the uh Dahlia cuh Championship  They do  yes yes steroids are a common  issue these days  Ih l also be vegetables pot plants floral uh arrangements and all sorts of things thats at the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show its the seventyeighth one and I think its children free three bucks to get in ten till threethirty uh also another event on today is the Cattai National Park Discovery Walk aln  the Hawkesbury River and along the clifftop Cattai visitors centre and tomorrow the Cumberland State Forest which is a fantastic little oasis in the  heart of the hills   Cumberland State Forest Castle Hill Road West Pennant Hills theyre doing a bush tucker walk where the rangers will take you through the bush youll get to identify edible food and then youll have a tasting as well I think adults are about three bucks children two bucks but you do need to book and the phone number for that nineeightsevenonedoublethreedoubleseven nineeightsevenonedoublethreedoubleseven and of course our open garden scheme garden which well talk about in the next half hour but with a fine day ahead of us lets find out whats happening in news headlines and good morning to John Hall    Thanks for that John and of course after the news at ten the Weekend Woodies resume their do it yourself home renovation and has Les managed to fix the horrible piece of mutilated timber that I gave him last week after I tried to make a shelf well find out about that tool of the week and a boofhead as well so thats stay with the weekend show    Right now Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and Colleens on the line in The Entrance how are you Colleen  Im very well thank you how are you  Very well but your agapanthus arent  No very sick  very sick  Yes theyve got a white powder sort of stuff all over them and the leaves turn crinkly and yellow and die  and it all goes to sorta jelly  Mm  Mm  Right it sounds theyre uh one of the worlds toughest um  plants the agapanthus What sort of conditions is it uh growing in  Well theyve been there for years doing fine um   theyre ou um plenty of light n um just I dont know up the backyard in the garden  Yep yep so theyre not uh yes I mildew  ih ih so you can rub th off this white  substance  And it goes right down into the to the uh centre of the plant  Mhm  Mm  Mkay  so its not a insect or anything like that  No no no no  It s it sounds like a fungus yeah Wuh yeah Ive dont Ive never struck agapanthus getting a powdery mildew or downy mildew but uh  I I guess its its uh it may be possible uh I guess fungicide would be uh indicated if if it is a fungus  Yeah  Um so  is it  I guess yeah without seeing it I I c Id be inclined to recommend that you take a sample along to to your local garden centre n  Yeah I I did think that yes  And get them to have a look at it  and um ih if theyve got a good horticulturalist there theyll be able tell you whether its fungal and and um recommend a a suitable fungicide Uh if it is powdery mildew something like one of the sulfur based fungicides would would be uh indicated  But uh Id I  And also with the local ones theyd know what was happening in the area too wouldnt they  Yes yeah but its  Yes and Ive got a good one at over at Ourimbah a big t  All Seasons nursery over there I think Ill take one s plants over there might be me b best shot  Would be a good idea I think  to get a a a visual ala   And they dont mind if you walk in  and say can I h can I have the orh the yknow the horticulturalists they sort of  Im sure theyd be  Theyd be happy to do that  Yes  Amenable but uh  In the yeah  Yeah  Its worth a try because Ive a loh Ive got a lot of agapanthus  Yes its unusual to to um hear of them having problems like that are they uh have they been divided up  No not recently no   Cos that can sometimes be a an issue with clumping plants like that as they get older uh the the clumps tend to sort of ih  W whats happened is some of the seeds have come off n and um yknow grown again and even the younger plants have got it  Mhm mhm  As well as the older ones mm  Yeah but if the clump is very sort of tight uh sometimes dividing in them up can reinvigorate them n and uh so if you dig up an old clump and and just uh uh split it gih give it a bit more sort of room to move  uh it starts to grow vigorously again and uh with something like agapanthus I would think it would would would be able to grow through a problem like that  So that I would suggest be another strategy you could employ  Okay then well uh  try all those and see what happens  Yeah  Alright Colleen  Okay then good thanks very much  Good luck  twentyfour minutes away from ten on sevenohtwo A B C Sydney    Two incidents causing problems today uh are at the moment there is an accident involving a car and a truck at Lane Cove West thats on Epping Road at Mowbray Road one of three westbound lanes are closed with moderate delays there and also Lidcombe Parramatta Road between Hill Road and Birnie Avenue One of two eastbound lanes closed uh not as sh many delays there but eastbound traffic affected by that one twentythree minutes away from ten    Weve just had somebody ring in to say that uh it could be mealy bug on the agapanthus  Wh mealy uh I mean I did did uh ask Colleen about insects uh mealy bug can actually look like uh a fungus uh because it it has that sorta white uh cottony appearance So thats why I think itd be good idea to get a a second opinion at a g uh someone who can look at   Hop along to the horticulturalist at the garden centre  Yeah yes if it is mealy bug then uh obviously it will need an entirely different treatment to a uh fungicide Itll need an insecticide uh or you can wipe wipe them off and uh go down that road uh but uh its its a very nasty problem the mealy bug one and Id be seeking help    Very shortly Jeanne Villani to talk about her open garden but first of all on the line is uh Lynne in Engadine how are you Lynne    Ah Lynnes playing the piano Hang on     Yeah no thats very good Lynne  Isnt that nice  Is that Rachmaninoff  Ah its rack something off but there we go at twentytwo minutes away from ten on sevenohtwo A B C Sydney Bernies on the line in Crows Nest Bernie can you play the piano for us as well  Uh no I cant  my little boy can  Oh can he  Yeah   Its alright honestly  You wanna r move a satin ash  Yeah a Windsor satin ash  Syzygium dansiei  Mhm  Just uh its about one and a half metres high  Yeah  Yeah  Um its been planted for about eighteen months just wanting to know if its okay to to move it  Well they can be a bit tricky Uh wuh uh I mean any evergreen plant that that is getting to that sort of size but look uh yes Syzygiums or lilly pillies are one of the more amenable plants to   to being pruned and then uh regrowing and and I think thats the key to transplanting uh evergreen plants when they uh the the biggest problem with them is water stress so if theyve got a lot of uh leafy growth as lilly pillies tend to do then it creates a lot of water stress on the plant if you damage the root system when you move it So what I would suggest is if you have no option but to move it is to to trim it back by about a third  and uh obviously take as big a root ball as possible but but uh giving it maximum protection when its uh been moved There are some commercial products that that you can spray onto the leaves to to limit the water loss um and uh really waiting until the weather cools down as well and the plant goes into a sort of a a uh semidormancy  Uh all those things will will maximise your chances of success  and it it should be possible a metre and a half it its getting to the limit of uh where its a a feasible idea but uh I think its definitely not impossible  Yep yep  Mm  Righto  Alright thank you very much  Thanks Bernie  Righto  Lets see if Lynnes still playing the piano    Thats beautiful isnt it  It is  Who would think Saturday mornings the best time just to sit listen to the radio   play a little bit of piano  Perhaps shes  Perhaps shes playing it to her um to her plant  Well shes got a cycad thats giving birth so maybe shes just playing the cycad soothing music in the nursery  Indeed  Good on you Lynne  Perhaps its still in the maternity ward  Uh that could well be the question uh uh Williams on the line in Artarmon hello William  Gday Simon how are you  Very well  The shot My question relates to mwah to tomatoes and rhubarb  Right  Last year we had a terrific crop of rhuba of uh tomatoes  And uh this year some wild tomato bushes have come up in the compost as a result of the compost  In the interim we planted nine um bushes of rhubarb  We had two uh meals off them  And now six of them have died is there any uh opposition to growing op uh rhubarb near tomatoes  Will tomatoes pick on rhubarb   Oh I wouldnt have thought so the the sort of issues uh youre looking at with uh vegetables are uh its crop rotation plants of the same family do tend to get similar diseases so yknow tomatoes and capsicums things like that theyre  very closely related  I see mm  But uh tomatoes and rhubarb are thats theyre a long way apart botanically so I wouldnt think there would be any link between  Want to give the game away if I cant grow rhubarb  Well its a c could be a number of of factors Ih uh  I know that from the provedores the fruit and veg guy the two things that have been causing problems this year have been rhubarb and tomatoes for the uh  commercial growers  Go on go on  So the wet weather the heat the wet weather the heat  have caused problems for particularly roma and those sort of  tomatoes  And uh rhubarbs been tricky as well  Ours apollo tomatoes and theyve been a terrific crop but we just had to change them to another bed this year  Right  Yes yeah  mm  Yes youve done the the right things there but certainly the the sort of conditions that that Simons describing uh weve had in Sydney as well and ih it it does tend to predispose plants to root rots  Uh would you suggest uh replanting rhubarb with new crop new  Yes but doing it in a different spot  In a different spot  Yes yeah  Okay  right  Good on you William nothing like fresh rhubarb is there  Enjoy your program  Thanks for being on it  Good on you mate  It is seventeen from ten a little musical interlude from Lynne    Its beautiful     No ones ever done that to me before rung up and played the piano to me  Yes  I feel I feel pressured uh precious and treasured  What about her cycad This must get  Well the cycad  very peaceful Lets  Twentyfour hours a day by the  Open the playschool window and see whos got their open garden this weekend    Jeanne Villani you play the piano as well dont you  No I dont I dont have time Im too busy gardening  I know cos the uh the size of of Waterfall Cottage how bigs the actual garden  Uh oh probably   three acres I would think of the eight acres the property It its hard to know because it sort of one blends into the other  And its in Bayview you get a lot of the sort of the the protection and rainforest around there from this beautiful gully isnt it  Yes yes its um sort of a bit cooler down here than it is in the outside world  The uh theres several different rooms we follow the gully down but youve got areas going off with a dovecot and palms and that sort of thing describe if I was to walk around the garden what would I see  Well at the moment youd see a lot of purple plectranthus because um its a   its a its a plant thats very hard to uh sorry very easy to uh take cuttings from and uh so Ive got a lot of it and it looks absolutely wonderful theres just big purple drifts The other thing thats uh looking particularly good at the moment is uh are the gingers and the bat plants in flower  Oh the bat plants are spectacular  Yes Yes and all the rainforest trees are now growing th that I planted to extend the rainflorist  forest belt Um to protect the house um Should the fires come  Um   theyre all growing now so uh yes theyre all different sort of areas  Youve retained a lot of the natural uh vegetation there too Jeanne  havent you  Yes yes theres a lot of uh large rainforest trees and then it uh goes off into the bush and uh   plus the wildlife so uh  The wildlife you mean the water dragons  Well no uh  theyre theyre no trouble because they eat the slugs and snails theyre wonderful but uh   once the drought was over the wallabies werent so bad eating all the uh all the buds on plants but uh now theres a family of brush turkeys have moved in and theyre uh relocating the mulch and uh  and some of the plants too while the uh while theyre about it  Have you got any tips on dealing with a uh malicious brush turkey  Jeanne  Ooh basting in a slow oven for four hours isnt it  They they look as though theyd be a bit tough  Now also around there are lots of ponds and indeed is the waterfall running  Uh no its stopped uh again because it hasnt rained since uh oh which was the day when we had all the heavy rain Wednesday I think  And it hasnt rained since then and it goes underground but um   uh further down the creek its running but it actually over the edge of the waterfall ih it isnt running at the moment unfortunately  Now I believe also that somebody works very hard cuh making all sorts of beautiful comestibles and teas  Mm  yeah theyre all ready all Ive gotta do is uh cut up the cake and uh were ready to go  And what is Jeannes cake this weekend  Oh well its lemon muffins and brownies and carrot cake  Oh yum  And have you got any lemon myrtle tea to go with it Jeanne  No lemon and ginger tea   Terrific or you need  some of those um  I could go and pick some lemon myrtle leaves and uh  Youve got a lemon myrtle bush there  Oh yes yeah  So people can have a look at that as well I always get the address wrong so give us to us again  Ninety  Yep  Cabbage Tree Road Bayview  Ninety Cabbage Tree Road Bayview which of course is on the northern beaches  Yes  Turn left at um   Avalon Am I right  No no no no no  No  No  um if youre coming down Mona Vale Road you turn left before you get into Mona Vale  Thats right  Yeah  Yes uh  No no dont go as far as Avalon  unless youre coming from Palm Beach   Thats right  So turn left at Mona Vale and its ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview today and tomorrow Jeanne  Thats right yeah  And from oh in about twelve minutes time  Yes ten till fourthirty  Well let you get into it and w how much are you charging for to go in  Uh five dollars fifty for adults and children are free  And uh bring in uh suh uh suh a blanket to sit on cos its a beautiful big garden Have a great weekend  Well there are lots of seats  Lots of seats  Yes  they dont have to sit on the ground  Alright Jeanne have a great weekend  Good thanks Simon  There we go Jeanne Villani there and the address is ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and a most impressive garden and uh you can see the lemon myrtle and maybe see the brush turkeys as well twelve minutes away from ten on sevenohtwo A B C Sydney the Weekend Show Angus there taking your calls and if youd like to ask a question for the Woodies theyre along after ten oclock as well    Now uh lets just   hear a little bit no its not there anymore lets see whether uh Beth wants to take Lynnes place do you Beth  I do indeed thank you so much   Playing piano or um  Definitely not no no  Youve got a cycad question  I have a cycad question I hope its the same question as  as the other ladys and it helps her out too I had a magnificent old cycad  that has been in my care for about fifteen years and um it appeared to go to cycad heaven And it was its in a pot  and I simply left it and um   when its rained its rained and uh its probably been I thought dead but well say dormant for  at least twelve months  And in the last month or so its had um a number of little cycads appear all around the edge of it  A mass masses of them  My question is um its in a pot theres not theres really not very much room around those edges  Are these   little ones are they independent plants and can I separate them or are they part of the assumed deceased cycad  Uh yes  yeah  Can I separate them can I do something cos they will not last in the pot the way they are  Yes you can they are uh little vegetative um buds that are sprouting at the base there sometimes called pups  and uh yes yeah they c they will uh gradually develop a an independent or root system of their own  which enables you to to split them off and pot them up  Right  So  when do you know is the right time to do that Angus  Well its uh Id Id wait for the sorta cooler weather but but also youll see uh if you dig actually try n uh uh lift one out whether its its got a bit of a a root system at the base  Right  So Id be guided by the the plants themselves  just uh theres a a lot of them you might just have a scratch around one n n see when its uh starting to develop a r a reasonable little root system of its own  Okay well there certainly are a lot of them   Ive I thought it was my my personal backyard phoenix  Ah  It sounds like it  Oh its been its been a nice surprise  Yeah  I was pretty ashamed of myself letting it die   Well there you havent let it die Obviously  if youve um youve nurtured it um  Its come back alright  Uh what sort of music have you been playing it just out of interest  to get that sort of result  Uh it gets the regular sounds of dogs barking and chooks cackling  Oh  yeah well maybe pianoll help   I thought  a bit of A C D C but itd have to be  A C D C for the cycads   Bon Scott variety   Can ih can I ask one other very quick question  Yep  At what point is it too late to try to transplant a potted citrus Where do you give up and just go buy a new one  Well   I think that this is true of all woody plants they they can get rootbound  and and thats the uh the biggest issue So really Id Id be guided by the the appearance of the root system When you take it outta the pot if you see a lotta roots curling around the bottom uh really to me to get a decent sort of citrus tree y youre going to have to perform drastic surgery to cut off all of those um sorta curled roots  and uh prune the top of the plant to to compensate for that  uh you you can resuscitate them and uh I would say its a kill or cure sort of  situation  and if you kill it well  g thats the time to go and buy an other one but  But it  Its sad already so  They are very resilient uh plants though  citrus uh but if you do sort of go down that route of uh the drastic prune of the roots and the top uh watch out for suckers coming from the rootstock  uh at the base of the plant itll sometimes induce those and youve just gotta uh knock those off with  your fingers  Mhm  But it it would be worth a try I would say to r to resuscitate it  but um  Again leave it leave it until a bit later on in the year  Yes yeah Id autumn really is  the perfect time  Okay terrific  Yeah  Alright  Got a few tasks to do thank you so much  Good on you  Beth byebye  Lets see what uh Lynnes playing nowadays   Ah youre not playing the piano anymore  Oh Simon look Im sorry   Dont be sorry it was it was a lovely interlude Youve  obviously practised that tune for a while  I know youre culturally appreciative so I thought that mightve been nice little interlude sorry about that my bad manners  It was b  but I think we might have answered your cycad question  Well mines just its about thirty years old and its huge about nearly a metre and a half high  and all of a sudden weve got a baby at the bottom of it  Mhm  A pup  Yes  Thats what theyre called  A pup  A pup  A pup of cycad  There we go  Okay so what what do I do  Yeah uh well I think just just wait to to the for the cooler weather and and you can actually just excise that from the plant  Uh provided its got a a few new little roots of its own  and pot it up into a uh and put it in a protected sorta position and uh with a bit of luck it it will just uh grow into a its own independent plant  Good  And the music  that Lynne should play to it you say A C D C  Well Ive always had good success with with uh the Bon Scott A C D C type but obviously piano is is good too  Working a treat  Good on you Lynne  Its  underrated I think music and  plants  Bye  Six minutes away from ten which means its uh less than uh ten minutes away from the Woodies and on the line we have Jack in Concord how are you Jack  Uh good morning Uh look I have um about sixteen golden diosma  Yep  Theyre the dwarf ones  Yes  And theyve been here for about two years  and theyve been going quite well  But in the last say two months Ive lost three of them  Theyve just uh dried up uh or  or somethings happened to them and theyre just dying  Okay so you seeing anything on the tops that   insect damage or fungal growth anything like that  No there doesnt seem to be anything wrong they were  going quite well  And then all of a sudden they just started to go brown  Uh lost their uh green and theyve just dried up  Mm mm or lost their gold in this case  Yes  Uh but look theres a couple of possibilities I can think of The golden diosma ih it actually belongs to the citrus family believe it or not um Rutaceae  and uh they can be a little bit susceptible to to rootrots uh and the weather weve been having would would uh with the humidity and so on would uh perhaps predispose the plants to something like phytophthora or rhizoctania one of the fungal root rots  uh so you could try something like uh Anti Rot on the plants that are are remaining to boost their sort of immunity to root rots if thats what it is but what I would be doing is is pulling up the the dead ones  and having a a look at their root systems uh because the other thing thats starting to uh come into play at the moment is uh curl grub uh curl grubs the larvae of the uh African black beetles  A few people weeding go isnt that cute Ive got a witchetty grub in my garden but its not is it  No theyre well usually theyre theyre uh curl grubs or something similar which are feeding on the root system And uh that can uh damage the plant in itself and it can also provide an entry site for these rootrots so Id be digging up the dead ones and and having a look at their root systems if you can find any of those curl grubs youll uh might need to take preventative action to to save the other  fifteen  golden diosmas  How do you get rid of the uh curl grub  Well there are various chemical treatments you can use um I guess thats probably the there is uh also a uh a nematode beneficial nematode that is available   for home gardeners that you can water in its a microscopic eelworm theyre called but they they can actually get into the curl grub and and uh kill it uh uh in a a more natural sorta fashion  Yes well where theyre growing uh like uh I had a natural garden along but  I dug those up and uh we had a lot of um oxalis growing  Now I had to get rid of that  so I sprayed it with um Roundup  nuh and then I covered it with um ah   uh uh um  Mulch  Gra brah uh grass mat  And then put pebbles on top  And uh but theyve been going quite well up till uh and these three are all
