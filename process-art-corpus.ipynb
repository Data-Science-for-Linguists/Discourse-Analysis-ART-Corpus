    "- The Australian Radio Talkback corpus contains raw text files of telephone conversations.\n",
    "- These conversations include the speaker's role (presenter, expert, or caller), name, and gender.\n",
    "- The conversations include other verbal cues such as laughter <laugh> and where a speaker says something during another speaker's turn <E1 yeah>. It also notes corrections to the transcription in squirrley brackets {}.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discourse Analysis Goals\n",
    "- commparing speakers by role and gender\n",
    "- aspects to consider:\n",
    "    - back channels (yeah, uhhu, that's great!)\n",
    "    - vocabulary size (avg word length)\n",

      "[Presenter 1: Tony Delroy, M] Eighteen minutes past ten eighteen past nine in Queensland eighteen past seven in Western Australia. Navigating the world of treatment for menopause can be a nightmare. In the last month we've seen the cancellation of a seven year trial in the states <,> sending more shockwaves through the community. Already a topic that causes a lotta confusion hormone replacement therapy or H R T has been controversial since its widespread use in the early nineties but does that mean it's not beneficial for some people. Menopause is different for each woman <,> uh some women suffer few side effects during the change as it's affectionately known and uh others suffer severe weight loss loss of sex drive uh mood swings and of course the dreaded hot flushes. So uh how do we make sense of everything that's on offer. To help us out tonight Dr Barry Wren is a guest. S one of Australia's leading researchers in gynaecological research and the author of a book called Understanding Menopause and Hormonal Therapy a Woman's Guide and uh he joins me in the studio tonight Barry good to see you.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Expert 1: Barry Wren, M] Yeah good evening Tony.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well uh let's start out at the beginning. The change the menopause what in fact is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well it's it's basically only just a time when a woman runs out of her own hormonal uh um production from her ovaries <P1 mm>. It begins around about the age of forty-five it's usually completed by the age of fifty-five. There's an average of about fifty-one years for women in Australia. And when it does those hormones which um influence the way cells will respond have just stopped being produced. And as a result of that women begin to deteriorate in certain areas. For some women it's uh disastrous and for other women they just as you said sail through without any problems <P1 mm> whatsoever.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] I I suppose uh menopause is a little more poignant at the moment simply because a lot of women waiting longer in life <,> uh before they uh have babies.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Uh exactly so I mean I I saw a lady only today who's aged thirty-five and is just going through the menopause at this moment. Her mother went through the menopause at the age of forty and uh uh her sister also went through uh at the age of thirty-eight so this lady at the age of thirty-five is now just starting her perimenopausal phase. She will almost certainly be completely out of all hormones within the next year and uh she's going to have another fifty years of uh menopausal uh symptoms and problems if we don't do something about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Gee whiz. Uh I I suppose that's a huge shock to her was she planning children or.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well it wasn't a shock because she expected something like this. Uh she's already had four children so that's <P1 mm oh okay> uh uh she she was quite expecting that she's a very intelligent lady with a university degree and so on and so she was not unaware of the problems and she came along to get some help from this stage onwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] One of the first things we need to have a look at tonight I think is the study in the United States <,> it's been going for seven years and uh it was uh cancelled because of uh the the some recent findings in the last month. Uh a lotta people not thrilled to death with this study uh a lotta people also supporting it. Um can you can explain to us exactly what the seven year study's all about.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yeah sh sure Tony there's actually two studies done by the same group it's the National Heart Blood and uh Lung Institute in the United States. Back in early nineteen-nineties they decided that because hormonal therapy appeared to be doing such a great job for women <,> and helping to prevent uh heart attacks uh osteoporosis uh quite a few other problems <,> that uh they should do woo call a prospective randomised blinded study. So they recruited women into this study and they were given two types of hormonal therapy they were given either oestrogen plus progestogen or they were given oestrogen alone. The women who had the oestrogen alone were women who had a hysterectomy and the women who were on the combined therapy uh were women who still had their uterus intact. There were sixteen-thousand-six-hundred in the women taking hormonal uh combined hormonal therapy <,> and about eleven-thousand in the study taking oestrogen alone. Two years ago they released the study results of the first one that's the sixteen-thousand-six-hundred women <,> and it suggested that women who were taking hormonal therapy at that stage had an increased risk of heart attacks stroke breast cancer but a decreased risk of osteoporosis. Just two years later they stopped the oestrogen alone arm of the study because uh there didn't appear to be any major benefit and there was a slight increase in the risk of stroke. And they didn't cancel it they just said that it didn't appear after seven years to be any major advantage of carrying the study on any further <P1 mm>. But there was no increased risk of uh heart attacks there was no increased risk of cancer in that group. So the big thing was why were all these studies showing some adverse results <,> and why were there differences between the two studies. Well when you look at the two studies there are some major flaws with the way they were structured. Most women in Australia going through the menopause are between forty-five and fifty-five years of age <,> and that's when they start getting their symptoms and they require some hormonal therapy. The studies in the United States recruited women who were somewhere between fifty and eighty years of age never having taken hormonal therapy beforehand. The <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] So wuh when you say hormonal therapy that's even the pill.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Even the pill yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Most of these women uh had uh no symptoms whatsoever no hot flushes no sweats and that was deliberately chosen because they didn't want women <,> to enter the study with some hot flushes who would either go onto hormonal therapy and find out that they were um participated or not go onto the hormonal therapy go onto a placebo and still have all their symptoms. So all these women had to have no symptoms whatsoever when they entered the study. Their average age was sixty-three years <P1 mm> which was quite considerably almost fifteen years older than the menopause. When we look at their uh demography we find that um most of them were very very overweight and matter of fact over a third of them were regarded as being obese. Thirty-seven percent were being treated for high blood pressure and other cardiac problems. Twelve and a half percent were being treated for high cholesterol levels. Four and a half percent were diabetic. Um there are fifty percent of them were smokers or ex smokers. Now all these factors increase the risk of cardiac disease so you take this group of uh women who had no symptoms with a high risk of having a cardiac disease and give them a an oestrogen by mouth. Uh you might get a slight increase in heart attacks and stroke and that's exactly what they found. It was not surprising and we feel it is <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] So you f believe it was a self fulfilling prophecy almost.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Virtually so it was a flawed suh it was a good study I must say uh a a very well conducted study but on the wrong group of people. Uh here in Australia most of the women are not in that particular category they're not that old they don't have those underlying conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm. Well uh f uh we'll start up with the pluses um uh mm perhaps you can describe what an average woman who was starting to go through the change would receive. Um as a treatment and what the benefits <E1 okay> of that was.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] W we've already said that the majority women going through the menopause will get hot flushes and sweats and they will have a dry vagina there will be an increase in uh osteoporotic changes. If they take hormonal therapy from the time of their menopause the beginning of all these symptoms then we can be sure they will have relief of those symptoms their vagina will remain moist and the risk of getting osteoporosis will be reduced considerably <P1 mhm>. The a large group of studies something like about a hundred and twenty that I've looked at which have been carried over the last forty years show that women who take hormonal therapy <,> from the time of the menopause without any underlying problems have a reduced risk of heart attacks and a reduced risk of uh some of the other major cardiovascular events. And uh this is something which is not shown up in this particular study this study suggest it's adverse <P1 mm>. Which is un.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] But you think it's a positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I think it's a positive yes I think it could be made a positive but women have to be very careful about. Obviously if a woman comes into my rooms at any stage at all who has some condition which would suggest that she may have an underlying uh heart attack or problems there I would be very very chary about giving her some hormonal therapy and if she wanted hormonal therapy I would probably give it through the skin or some other means <,> rather than through the gut and the mouth and the liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm now um th they're the some of the positives negatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Negatives hormonal therapy if it's given in an inappropriate way can produce uh things like bloating it can produce some breakthrough bleeding if the uterus is still present. Can produce some breast discomfort that's mastalgia because of the changes to the breast <,> um they're the basic things which most women will have as an adverse effect and there are some local things uh sometimes taking it by mouth will produce some nausea uh a few problems like that. If you take it through the skin it'll produce some skin irritation. Are suh uh some adverse change but we can always readjust those hitches to suit each particular patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm I suppose where we are moving into areas where we're we're not certain and that is the length of uh treatment for hormone replacement therapy <,> uh because it's a relatively new therapy um I suppose we're we're s stepping off the cliff cliff to a degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh uh can I correct you on this Tony it's not relatively new it started in nineteen-thirty-two so it's over seventy years of use of hormonal replacement therapy now. We have a lot of experience with it's use <P1 mm> and um there are now very long m major studies where women have been taking well over thirty years and have a very good outcome from that uh period of time. Matter of fact back in July of two-thousand-and-two when all this <,> first of the uh major negative studies came out my phone rang hot from patients ringing in <,> and one patient rang in I just couldn't remember her her history very well but I asked her how long she'd been taking therapy. And she said thirty-six years and I said how do you feel she said great I'm the semi finals of the club championship but I wanna keep on going <P1 mm>. Now y'know th ah that's one swallow doesn't make a summer but the big thing is that women can take it while ever they wish to. They need to be monitored the whole time though.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm okay so I mean what six monthly or yearly or.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I generally see a patient every year when she's on hormonal therapy I probably see her twice in the first year when she starts on treatment to make sure everything's fine. But after that once every year from that point onwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm breast cancer is that an issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yes breast cancer is there's there's no doubt that um women who have breast cancer uh l let me just sort of uh go back one step. It takes a long time for a single cell which has undergone an a series in mutations to eventually grow into a mass that we can actually see or feel. Some people have estimated it may take up fifteen years. If a woman is taking hormonal therapy whilst that uh cancer is growing it'll grow faster and it will show up earlier. This may be a negative or it may be a positive for her <,> but there's no doubt that women who have cancer probably shouldn't be taking oestrogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm it is a matter of fact that as women grow older the percentage of women likely to get breast cancer increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh yes it's an age related disease. At the age of fifty there's about one in a hundred women will have breast cancer and it doubles itself virtually every decade from there on so at the age of ninety it's around about fifteen per hundred women will be found to have breast cancer. So it just keeps on increasing every decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm is there any connection between breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well yeah there is I mean um men get breast cancer at about wuh only one uh man for every hundred women so it's a basically it's a female dominated uh type cancer but that relates to the number of times that the cells are multiplying in what are relatively large breasts compared to a male's breast. So we have a a problem of size and the number of cells which are present <,> but cancer is a series of mutations and the they're a sporadic spontaneous and sequential mutations which take place within cells anywhere in our body including the breast and hormones increase the rate that those cells are undergoing mutations but don't cause the mutations.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm Barry when uh when you're seeking advice on menopause should you consult your local G P or should you find yourself a specialist in hormone therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh I think the majority of G Ps are fairly well uh aware of the menopause itself. What worries the general practitioner at present is the fear of making a mistake <P1 mm>. Of not doing the right thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Can be very expensive these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Right yeah it's a it's a terrible thought and the majority or general practitioners are fighting shy of it right now because of all the publicity. The majority of general practitioners don't get a chance to read all the uh fine detail which I have to spend time reading or some of my colleagues have to spend time reading. So they're not always up to date with all the information but rather than give a negative point of view to a patient they'll give s often no point of view at all they wih they will often say to the patient don't take it uh and it's a negative one without knowing all the facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Alternative therapies uh I mean how do you feel about them and uh I I know you were saying during the news that you wouldn't personally uh prescribe that for anyone. Ah but you you don't feel opposed to to <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] No I I have no opposition to um alternative therapies uh because most of them uh wuh all the research which has been done on them show that they don't have any major effect whatsoever. However if a patient or a doctor believes that they're going to help them <,> uh from a e m a from a placebo point of view they can be very very helpful they can have people believe that they're helping and that's very good and if people believe in something I think that's there's a great help to that. What distresses me is that sometimes people take them for the wrong reason uh with the wrong expectation. Uh obviously um most of these alternative therapies will not help things like osteoporosis or prevent a heart attack or <,> do something like that but they won't cause breast cancer and they won't cause some of the other diseases which may be um associated with hormonal therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm menopause is uh as we've said earlier a difficult time for the person going through it but it can also be quite a difficult time for partners and for uh for friends as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Um is there anything people can do to uh sort of ease ease that particular time because uh y'know obviously um a person going through this period ih thi they are a bit racked and uh and uh can pass on that uh <,> unpleasantness to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] You you're right I mean but knowledge is power knowledge is everything so I believe that both men and women partners uh people who have any experience their children <,> should all try and learn as much as they can about the problems associated with the menopause so they can help uh the person who's suffering from the problems understand it or take care of them or advise them in some way. And in a way I mean I'm not trying to uh say go and buy my book but uh what I'm trying to say in my the book which I've just written. I'm trying to give information to women and anybody else who cares to read it exactly what is happening what it all means and I think it's important to gain that insight and that information.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm I mean would it benefit some women to get some psychological help sometimes if they if they feel that they've been impacted greatly by the by the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I I think that um the menopause doesn't produce psychiatric disturbance let me say that <P1 mm> uh m changes to a person's body can accentuate an underlying problem. Now if the woman uh who in question does have an underlying psychiatric problem which is accentuated then it may help her to see some psychological or psychiatric help but basically <,> it's in the hands of the general practitioner who looks at the total picture sees the patient and tries to decide exactly what areas of help are needed for that particular patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm how much fine tuning goes on with the uh y'know getting it right for the patient so that uh obviously you c you can't uh y'know uh one cap fit fits all uh y'know you you require some s s some tinkering at the edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yeah it's uh look it's very important. I give every patient something like uh about half an hour to an hour to try and find out what uh what the patient feels like what's bothering them and so on like that. And in trying to decide on the type of therapy I take into account their background their physical ah situation other things which may be affecting them. In the hope that in some way uh I can get the therapy regimen right for them. Uh and a lotta doctors do exactly the same but time is the big constraint for this and when you're trying to decide on um a type of treatment sometimes it's much easier for a doctor just to pluck something off the shelf and if that doesn't work say ah well it's not going to work. That's an unfortunate way of doing it <P1 mm>. But I always believe in getting a second opinion for all these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yeah so quite often uh the first treatment won't be the last treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] It's uh sometimes I've changed my treatment I was looking at a patient I saw today who's been with me for over twenty years and we've changed her treatment six times during that particular twenty years but each time things have got better for her and she's been reasonably happy at this stage.\n",

      "\n",
      "[P1] Welcome uh y y you wanted to talk about why you decided to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C1] Yes um I was taking Premarin and Provera Dr Wren for for ten years I started in my late forties and um I had uh a very good um gynaecologist who used to see me every six months and uh and monitored me quite closely. But um I decided that uh when this survey came out that I would stop and my G P said I think maybe you've taken it long enough and uh the doctor I was going to retired and I had to go to another doctor and he said the survey was a lot of hooey and that it wouldn't bah matter if I went back on it but I decided not to <,> but since then I've had hot flushes which are just dreadful but um that's the only thing and so my doctor put me onto patches and I started having terrible periods again so I went off the patches and I didn't have any breakthrough bleeding when I was on the others well hormone replacement therapy. I just wondered what you thought about um um this situation I I have felt that maybe I was on it long enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Carol it's very difficult to uh say y you <C1 yes> should or shouldn't be on it at all you're the person who's in charge of your own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C1] Yes true.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] And um I believe that women take hormonal therapy really to improve the quality of their life <C1 mm mm>. Y'know your life appears not to be as good as it should be and it could be that if you took the appropriate hormonal therapy you'd be fine <C1 mm>. Now the patches appear not to have done the job for you <C1 no> but I can assure you there are many other types of therapies <,> which you could try <C1 mm> you could even go back onto the Premarin and Provera and you'd probably do just as well on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C1] Really.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I wouldn't have any hesitation in saying that if your quality of life is diminished then probably you should be back onto it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C1] Mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C1] But but how long do you keep on taking these.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well it's a very personal thing you see I have some patients who've tried stopping it at the age of seventy and or even as l late as eighty <C1 mm> and their problems all come back <C1 oh> and just feel dreadful and they go back onto it <C1 I was shocked>. But they've been on it for twenty to thirty years <inaudible>.\n",

      "\n",
      "[C1] Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Um twenty percent of women go through the menopause and never have a hot flush or a problem at all <C1 yes>. Uh eighty percent do have some problems but as the years go by that diminishes <C1 mhm> but at the age of eighty-five <C1 mhm> uh twenty percent of women still have all those problems <C1 oh no> <C1 laughs>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Something to look forward to Carol.\n",

      "[P1] No problem whatsoever thanks <laughs>. Uh Helen um y you're sixty-six and uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 2: Helen, F] Yeah I'm still having hot flushes <P1 mm> um I just wondered how long does it go on for <inaudible> <E1 laughs> <E1 well> taken hormone replacement therapy <E1 yeah> and I've got these dreadful hot flushes when does it end.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well for you it may never end or it may diminish as time goes on <C2 inaudible> you can never tell now no one has any knowledge as to who will continue and who won't <C2 right>. Um I just say to women who are suffering as you are <,> to go onto hormonal therapy get under the uh care of a good doctor who will look after you and monitor the whole program for you <C2 mm> and uh just take care of yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C2] So there's no virtual like they say oh you're fifty you shouldn't be having this <E1 laughs> something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] No <C2 inaudible> I wish it was like that and I keep on trying to remind people that there is no such thing as uh this is just going to last a few years <C2 mm>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Helen when when they said sixty is the new forty you see <all laugh> unfortunately it has its complications <all laugh> good on you thanks for that. Viv um you want to talk about the pill if you're already having uh ye osteoporosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 3: Viv, F] Yeah thanks Tony yeah um I've already got osteoporosis I've had it since I was in my twenties and I'm not at menopause yet I'm forty-three now. But um I plan to go on H R T later on to stop any more osteoporosis later on. But I was wondering should I be on does the pill make any difference to bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] No well the pill is really only just another form of hormonal therapy <C3 inaudible> it's a stronger uh type of therapy it contains uh similar to sorts of progestogens to the um hormonal therapy but the oestrogen that's used is a synthetic one called ethanol oestradiol and uh that's much more potent. But um uh it is <C3 inaudible> it's very similar in every other way but if you have osteoporosis now you may be better off going onto one of what we call the bisphosphonates they're a group of chemicals which <,> help uh build calcium into bone and make the bone a bit stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C3] Yes that's that's uh things like Fosamax isn't it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] That's right yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C3] Well they wuh they won't allow premenopausal women on it unless they've already had a fracture. Uh and um.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well they will let them on it <C3 inaudible> but the government won't give you the uh P B S uh rebate uh you have to pay the full price yourself <C3 yes yes> unfortunately. Don't go out and break a bone deliberately to get it. It's cheaper though.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C3] No no I I do think that I should break my big toe but <C3 and E1 laugh>. Um could I also ask for older people my mother didn't start H R T until she was in her late sixties. And because I was afraid about her having osteoporosis and I suggested and then with the scare she went off it. Is there any danger in take taking it after the menopause is well and truly over or.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh no no I mean I've got women who come to me uh I had a lady who uh was widowed went through the menopause um everything was fine she didn't take anything at all till she turned sixty-eight and she developed a new relationship a sexual relationship and uh she found that the vagina was so dry she couldn't have intercourse and she started on hormonal therapy then and she's very happy <C3 yep> and her partner's very happy now mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C3] Okay thank you very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Viv uh great to hear from you Joan uh uh you have a a a health issue here you've got uh superficial blood clots.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 4: Joan, F] That's that's correct yes yeah I had a hysterectomy twelve months ago. I've been put on Premarin six point six-two-five and this is my second superficial blood clot I do have varicose veins would you advise me to continue um.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Uh I wouldn't give you anything by mouth. Um when uh oestrogen goes through the mouth and the gut it passes directly to the liver ninety percent of the uh oestrogen goes to the liver where it stimulates the liver cells to work better <C4 mhm>. And part of the production of the liver cells are the proteins which produce coagulation <C4 right> so taking it by mouth tends to increase the risk of getting a coagulation whereas if you take it through the skin <C4 yeah> it avoids that and you can have the benefit of the oestrogen without the stimulus to the liver at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C4] Oh I see okay so you uh through the skin and not through the mouth uh um and would should I go off the tablets while I have these uh superficial blood clots or.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh yes yes I mean you're I wouldn't take anything by mouth if you've got those uh <C4 yes>. Mind you it's it's the deep venous thromboses which we're really concerned about if you've got some superficial thromboses you probably shouldn't take the tablets by mouth but you be d on a patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C4] On the patch oh that's good okay thank you very much for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Joan great to hear from you uh Judy um you you want to talk about nonhormonal medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 5: Judy, F] Yes um my G P prescribed a something called l Livial.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Livial yes that's a that's a <C5 w> an interesting steroid compound.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C5] I just sorta wondered what kind of y'know long term studies have or has been done or <,> has it not been around l long enough to have had um that much experience so <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well it's been av uh available in U K for oh over fifteen years now so there's fair amount of a sort of background to it. In Australia it's been here for five or six years and uh we've also had reasonable experience with it. Um it's a steroid compound which has uh basically a progestogenic and an androgenic activity normally that's a male type of hormone but it can be converted by uh enzymes in your system into an oestrogen. And uh so it has a weak oestrogenic activity as well and it's quite good and we particularly uh recommend it for women who've got sore breasts and so on like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C5] So it can more or less take the place of hormonal therapy if you don't want to go down that<inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well it yeah it is a form of hormonal therapy I mean we we <C5 inaudible> it's it's a steroid the same as uh oestrogen progesterone and tostesterone are steroids so it's got um a steroid activity but it's been chemically manufactured and it's not similar to the um uh it's it's one which you wouldn't extract in a human or you can't y get from a human it's gotta be manufactured.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C5] Would you have the same possibilities of um the various medical risks <E1 well uh> associated with the <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] The one study which was done in the United Kingdom called the million women study suggested that the uh Livial actually increased the risk of uh breast cancer being diagnosed. Uh however there's a little bit of doubt shown uh or expressed about that million women study because of what we call a cohort study and there are a lot of sort of um problems with its actually sort of uh structure which uh we can't always be sure. We really need to do some uh double blind randomised studies with Livial to see whether it has an adverse effect on breast cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C5] Would you be happy enough to prescribe Livial to to your patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh I do indeed yes I have quite a number of patients on Livial and I have no real problems with its use. But I I must warn people that there is not that nothing's perfect in life and Livial may turn out to be uh as adverse as uh oestrogen is thought to be adverse on breast cancer. But at present I believe it's perfectly okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C5] So for what kind of y'know term therapy could you sort of feel that you could safely prescribe it for like five years ten years.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] At this stage uh again like uh women who um have um hor ordinary hormonal replacement therapy they should take it while ever they feel it is doing them some good with their quality of life. Uh doctors shouldn't be pontificating so you must stop it after five years the <C5 no> patient must make up their own mind <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C5] Studies have indicated <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Alright Judy thanks for the call great to hear from you Lynne uh you you've actually written a paper on this and and you've got a slightly different view.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 6: Lynne, F] Yes um my uh just briefly my own personal history was um <clears throat> I'm in my mid fifties now but I started going through perimenopause uh at about the age of about thirty-seven-thirty-eight and uh ran into terrible problems unbelievable problems couldn't think straight hot flushes couldn't sleep ye the whole lot and uh the doctor put me on the usual uh Premarin and Provera. Which just made me violently ill even though it did solve the um menopause caused um problems that I was having <P1 mhm> so I had to swap to um finally when it was a available I had to swap to the uh skin um absorbed uh oestrogen and progesterone uh and I used a natural oestrogen and a natural progesterone and uh I'll explain the reason for that because most of the problems that women have um with uh things like premenstrual tension endometriosis breast cancer fiboy fibroid tumours of the uterous <,> et cetera and menstrual flooding are caused by oestrogen dominance. And uh this is where the oestrogen does not balance with the progesterone that we have because a woman is getting too much oestrogen um by an intake of xenoestrogens or foreign oestrogens which the body accepts as oestrogen but they're toxic and they don't act as natural oestrogen and they get these xenoestrogens well they're all <P1 mm> throughout the environment they're in pesticides whence they enter the food chain all petrochemical products <,> they're in cosmetics detergents cleaning products there's uh a compound called nonylphenyl <P1 yeah> as well as um plastics where they're absorbed to any food stored in 'em <E1 mhm>. So women are getting too much oestrogen and yet when they go on hormonal therapy the first thing the doctor does is give them more oestrogen.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Barry <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well uh that's uh the s hypothesis you're putting forward is the one put out by John Lee <C6 that's right>. Um John Lee's an interesting man I think it's worth making a comment about him he unfortunately he died last October and I used to have a few arguments with John at various times. John was a ph <,> pharmacist and back in nineteen-seventy-four he attended a lecture by Ray Peat. Uh at which Ray Peat said it would be a good idea if we could give progesterone um by some means rather than the mouth because progesterone is broken down so rapidly in the gut and the liver. So he suggested that it would be reasonable to give that progesterone as a cream but no one had ever used it then so John Lee as being a pharmacist and then just being a general practitioner in seventy-four went back and developed his own progesterone cream. He then started a company called Avion Pharmaceutical Company uh to produce this progesterone cream and he spent the next uh thirty years of his life uh trying to promote the idea and he wrote most of the um points in little pamphlets about how good it was. When people began to criticise him because it didn't have any real scientific basis he then made up the story which you've just uh told us very nicely and um yeah of course it doesn't hold up because there's no scientific backing for it at all. We've done some of the studies and there's a huge number of uh people have done studies on this particular type of hypothesis of John Lee's. It's just shown to be uh bit of oh rubbish really doesn't hold any kind of water really and I feel sorry that you've been sort of misled by that uh hypothesis of John Lee's but uh it's it's not uh a scientifically valid uh proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Alright Lynne thank thanks for raising it Edith um uh you wanna talk about alternative uh medication a and self medication.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 7: Edith, F] Oh that's correct yes I've got three issues to bring up. Um first of all I'm forty-nine years old uh and I'm not obese I'm not a smoker um but I did have um an ovary removed when I was forty-two. Um I was extremely disappointed that the gynaecologist didn't discuss with me how this would affect my menopau uh menopause <P1 mm>. Does ovary removal actually bring an early onset of menopause.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yes did you have a just one ovary removed <C7 that's right> or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C7] Yep.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I'm sorry.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C7] One.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Just <P1 just the one> the one.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C7] Yep.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] The other one that should still I mean it's like removing a kidney um the other ovary will go on functioning until it runs out of its normal uh eggs and that's usually about the normal of um forty-five to fifty-five.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C7] Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Uh have you uh started the menopause as yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C7] Oh yes yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] You have yeah. It it coulda been produced by the um surgery uh obviously I mean you can ha have interference with uh the blood supply to the remaining ovary under these conditions that might have uh faded away a bit earlier that it woulda done under normal conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C7] Okay. Well the second issue I wanna bring up is um the issue of alternative therapy it actually does work um because I've refused to go on H R T so I've been experimenting for qu well ever since I've been forty-two <E1 yeah> <P1 mhmm>. Um but I have found that of course it's only short term and it may last for three or four months and then y'know you you look at then you have to look at self medicating. And that's another worry for me is is ha I'm on three alternative therapy medications now. Uh I don't know who to turn to to say yes that's too much or no y'know you shouldn't be doing that because I I don't know if there's much research on self medication <,> but I find it difficult there's no registry to say that there's specialists in menopause that look at both alternative therapies and H R T. But um y'know I don't have that choice and uh I find it difficult how do I ascertain what is what is the a a good level to to maintain alther alternative therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well uh there are two parts to it uh that you've explained uh and we've done a lot of work a lotta people have done some research on alternative therapies by the way um. The big thing is that we look at what is natural the previous uh caller um Lynne I think it was talked about natural oestrogen um possibly implying that the pharmaceutical companies don't use natural oestrogen well they do but um you produce from your ovary something called seventeen beta oestradiol <C7 yeah>. Which is very rapidly uh metabolised to uh something called oestrone which is much weaker than oestradiol <C7 yeah> and then eventually it's metaboli that again is metabolised within probably two or three hours to oestriol which is the excretory product. Now um those things are found in every woman's body throughout her normal reproductive life when she goes through the menopause um the levels fall down she stops producing oestradiol but there is still some oestrone being produced and thats being produced by conversion of other products what we call precursors sometimes from the adrenal gland sometimes from other areas into oestrone and that's uh reasonably active uh throughout most women's lives but whether it's enough for your needs depends on so many different factors. Uh for the majority of women going through the menopause it's not enough and they need some top up.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C7] Mm yeah well it certainly might be in my case uh since the hot flushes I can tolerate but it's the sleep deprivation <,> <E1 yeah> that uh causes the problems you you're waking up three-four times a night.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] You you probably need to have your levels of uh oestradiol measured <C7 uh huh> and as the if there is sufficient oestradiol there it will act on your brain and the pituitary phos uh pituitary gland to um <,> uh reduce the level of follicular stimulating hormone and I use the level of follicular stimulating hormone and oestradiol as an indication as to whether the patient is getting sufficient oestrogen or not. Um and if you see somebody with some expertise in the area you will probably find that they will measure those and tell you whether you have got sufficient uh oestrogen in there to stop your hot flushes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Thanks uh Edith uh Karen you you wanna talk about attitudes to this whole issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 8: Karen, F] Well yes I do I've had I'm one of the alternate people and I've had fantastic results not only through my menopausal time but with other bodily problems through changing my diet 'n' going back to foods that don't come from a factory <,> and I h um haven't gone onto H R T I don't like the stories I've heard about the suffering of mares in the northern hemisphere to get the necessary oestrogen for H R T. Um.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Ye you're talking about Premarin there I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C8] Look I don't know um which specific I'm talking about it's the horse stories that bother me so much but I also want to make two strong points it isn't menopause isn't necessarily something to be suffered and also it isn't just a hormonal and bodily change I've found incredible new wisdoms have come to me <,> about life through my menopausal years so it's not just a hormonal and bodily change it's far broader than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh you're quite right I mean <,> I don't want you to feel that um uh women have to have it or have t h suh h suffer any symptoms. Uh quite a large number of women have no problems whatsoever going through the menopause either <,> physically or mentally or uh uh emotionally in any way at all but others are affected and we should not e or nobody should say oh because I didn't have any problems then somebody else shouldn't have any either.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm Karen thank you very much for your thoughts uh Ruth um you you want a word about relationship between migraines and the menopause.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 9: Ruth, F] Yes thank you Tony. Um I've been suffering migraines for about twenty years I get about two a month always around the same time <,> and my doctor keeps telling me that when I go through menopause they'll go away. Um I'm forty-nine I'm just premenopausal I suppose although I'm still getting regular periods. I'm just wondering if I go onto H R T if I need to. What's gunna happen with my migraines.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh that's a very good question and uh thank you for asking it. The big thing to remember is that both men and women get migraines so it's <C9 mm> not just uh to do with hormones <C9 mhmm>. However if hormones are a cause for uh migraine headaches it's usually because there is some triggering either a high level or a low level suddenly occurring <C9 mhm>. So women who are menstruating <,> normally of course the levels of hormones go up and down they <C9 mm> fluctuate <C9 yes> throughout the month and it's that fluctuation or rise and fall that so often triggers the migraine <C9 that's right> headache <C9 yes>. When you go through the menopause if your hormo if your migraines are produced by hormones taking a continual daily dosage should relieve that <C9 ah okay> particular problem. Or if the levels go right down and you've got no hormones at all present and there's no f triggering their either <C9 no> they will probably disappear.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C9] So w w perhaps then it would it even be it may prove helpful to go onto H R T just to for the migraines.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Oh it it is I mean I have a lot of patients who are in their twenties and thirties that I have treated and relieved I hah I don't cure anything but I relieve their menopausal symptoms and triggers by giving them uh various types of hormonal therapies which will give them no uh uh triggering uh f rise or fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C9] Okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Alright Ruth thanks for the call uh we don't have time for another one uh we did have a a caller ring in saying can trauma bring on an early menopause.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Uh depends on the trauma if it's a trauma to the pelvis such as involving the uh ovaries or to the pituitary gland uh it may bring on a premature menopause but <,> uh trauma to the legs or the arm is unlikely to do something like that.\n",

      "[P1] I was astounded today by the comment of a good friend who said that she hates getting the train to work now. Because she fears trains could be a terrorist target. I guess what shocked me was that someone who I've always considered being intelligent and of sound judgement is now scared to perform a simple everyday task like commuting to work. Tt makes you wonder to what extent we're all frightened and that we might be at the centre of the next terrorist attack. Obviously the latest bombings in Madrid have focused us on the on the potential <,> for such a horrific thing to occur in our own back yard <,> and news reports say that uh a video tape received by the Spanish government claimed that the Al Qaeda terrorist network was responsible for the bombings which last week killed two hundred and injured many many more. The attack was reportedly a payback for Spain's cooperation with the United States over Iraq. So where does that leave us so I guess even the Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Kelty uh appears to have contradicted a key government message by claiming <,> Australia's decision to commit troops to Iraq has possibly increased the risk of Australia becoming a terrorist target. Now that does make me feel a little nervous but prime minister Howard is sticking to the key message saying there's no direct link between the Madrid bombings and Australia. He says all western countries are in fact potential terrorist targets. Australia is now in the process of analysing its own antiterrorist laws but can any amount of police protection guarantee the safety of a nation's citizen. I think not uh even Mr Howard acknowledges <,> that life must go on and that governments are limited in what they can do. He says the idea that you can guard every movement of every person on every railway station in every part of Australia is lunatic. It's unrealistic. So w <,> how safe do you feel. I mean is your life affected by the threat of terrorism. It's our issue tonight the threat of terrorism here on our shores like to have your thoughts.\n",

      "[P1] The next issue is how far do we go to try and ensure our safety. Should our authorities be given broader powers. Something that New South Wales is certainly having a look at uh the Herald is reporting tomorrow <,> that uh the security laws that have been put in place already will be reviewed to see if they need to be toughened. Because uh <,> the meeting that took place in Sydney indicated that um Sydney could be a major target. Tt following the attacks in Madrid prime minister Howard ordered a national meeting of transport security chiefs. That was uh that's coincided with the start of this five day annual security conference in Sydney in which the police chiefs from all the states 'n' t all the territories along with uh some of their counterparts from Asia will look at how Australia and its near neighbours can actually better counter this terrorism threat. New South Wales premier Bob Carr delivered the keynote speech and presented his five point plan on counterterrorism. It includes uh a major review of all New South Wales offences which could be linked to a terrorist act or threat <,> sharing information between state and federal governments and agencies <,> and the concept of setting up a ministry for homeland security. I guess similar to the American model. Er the federal opposition leader Mark Latham is also calling for a one stop shop. Saying what's needed here is an integrated coordinated approach to protect commuter transport networks. Police and security experts are also pushing for an overhaul of of Commonwealth counterterrorism laws which they claim harm their ability to find and charge terrorists. New South Wales police commissioner Ken Moroney is saying that the primary police <,> concerns uh are lifting restrictions on how long terror suspects could be detained. And being permitted to use material gathered with listening devices as evidence in court. Currently most listening device warrants issued for terror investigation can only be issued for intelligence gathering purposes <,> not in courts. Also on the commissioner's agenda are moves for police to take greater control of the area around scenes of terror attacks and to use security guards as a as a quasi counterterrorist spy network. Now this follows the news that the federal government plans to introduce a new offense of consorting with terrorists. The laws would be loosely based on some state laws which jail people who associate with criminals.\n",

Like to hear your comments. Some interesting uh material in in uh what the papers were saying. Uh they're suggesting that the F B I has clearly stated that Australia is a terror target. I know it's not something the prime minister wants to hear but uh the F B I is saying yes it is <,> Sydney could be one city um but it could be Canberra it could be Melbourne. I suppose um the instant reaction to the Spanish <,> bombings where we saw a government thrown out over the weekend because of its poor response to terrorism <,> has sent a an extra chill through some western governments. You uh saw the conservative government that had been closely associated with <,> George W Bush uh a strong supporter of Tony Blair um basically chucked out of office. And uh the socialist government that has come in in Spain is saying we are pulling our troops out of Iraq by June if there isn't a U N mandate in place if there's not U N <,> control of what's happening in Iraq. So um y'know as much as we say y'know the the thing that we want to avoid is having the terrorist attacks influence us uh I suh I suppose in Spain it's had a very direct influence a change of government.\n",

That one of the upshots of it is the fact that if you've got four-hundred-thousand Muslims in Australia which we now have according to the Australian <,> um it makes the the job diabolically difficult uh because the nature of terrorism is it hides amongst <,> people uh causes great difficulties and great rifts within the population and really that's what I had to say that uh we were going to be a terrorist target anyway.\n",

And uh there was no warning <coughs> that this was going to happen and uh it's amazing because the uh Spanish have a very very large police force as you probably know.\n",

      "[C39] And uh a very active intelligence system because Morocco is so close to them.

      "\n",
      "[C39] Yeah but there was a long interval and they should have got to that to the source of that uh cell phone the sim card a lot quicker than they did. The Spanish people were protesting against Aznar because he had lied to them. And they didn't like that and they also were protesting because the intelligence services had failed and I would think that uh the question of lies uh might take us back to children overboard. And there might be a lesson there somewhere for this government.\n",

And uh it's a bit spooky to to find yourself uh linked uh with this coalition. But um I mean that's life we've been taken there and um uh we have to live with it and I just hope and I have great faith in uh in uh Keelty the commissioner. I think he is a good man I think he's a very honest man and I think he's extremely bright.

      "\n",
      "[Caller 40: Rick, M] Yes I think um there's just been a a bit of a shift I've noticed in the last couple of days with Mr Howard um originally talking up the terrorist angle and using it I think in the same way as your previous caller talked about with the children overboard situation where it's a wedge politics to make people feel a sense of fear whether it's true or not. We all know now that it's true and as soon as this uh evidence comes back that it is true with things like the bombing in Madrid he seems to um take another tact and try and remove himself from having um any responsibility involved with um bringing Australia into this situation. I just think that your first caller originally when you first started this segment before the news spoke about multiculturalism and said that he felt it was a problem I think it's actually the key. I think an open hearts and open minds sort of attitude with an alternative to conflict and tension and the attention that can be gained through this sort of action needs to be defused I mean ten years ago this country was sort of put up on a pedestal was a model for the rest of the world in how well multiculturalism was working here <P1 mm> and in freedom of religion in freedom of speech and freedom of belief and and I just don't know where we're going. I think ten years ago we were on the right track and we had good relationships with our um neighbours in Asia and around the general region and I just think this move away to the right has been extremely damaging but I'm hoping that it's the last swing to the right that we get for some time because these things always seem to have a pendulum affect and I think we're swinging back the other way now and I think it's high time and I just hope that we haven't done too much damage that is irreversible.\n",

      "[Caller 41: Jean Pierre, M] Yes I mean like leh let's face it you can put uh uh whatever change whatever law you want up to this or that but I don't think it's gunna <,> uh influence a decision of somebody who's gunna decide to blow a bridge or anything like that <P1 mm>. Um the the major part I took offence to the chap just before the news uh who seemed to blame the Muslim. And he he made a reference to his Jewish friend who has to close the door. Um we were all screaming our head off um uh in February last year or sometime last year because um Iraq had the twelve years to uh or ten years to <,> obey U N resolution but every for body seemed to forget that since nineteen-sixty-seven Israel has forgotten to um uh imply the uh is uh the United Nation resolution they must pull out of the West Bank and Palestine. And basically the whole Al Qaeda movement was based for that. If you take Bin Laden if you sort of study um his early beginning and all his whole life <,> he he only had two reasons for being it. First it was to overthrow the government in Saudi Arabia which is rotten and corrupt <P1 mm>. Two to um prevent um Israel from destroying Palestine and therefore he was an eme enemy of the American. Right. Now if you don't need the problem pretty soon we will create a rift between the Christian and the Muslim which eventually uh the the Muslim country have a lesser living of standard than the western world and it's very easy for anybody who takes over down there to use the western world as a c scapegoat.\n",

      "[P1] It is impossible to defend against somebody who's prepared to die for a cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C41] That's right and when you think about the intelligence from the America I mean American spent as as b I think the C I A on its own has a bih a forty billion budget but yet. Wha wha what what did they knew about Spain. Absolutely nothing <P1 mm>. Right and uh we just can't cope to keep on saying we need America we need America we need America <,> I can't stuh uh uh stick <inaudible> hang on America need us too you know. What about pine uh Pine Gap. Where they gunna put that <P1 tt> I mean that's a big part of their uh o of their anti espionage thing. What about the um the big um radar in uh near Canberra with the needs for the NASA and things like that <P1 mm>. Y'know so ih it's not just saying y'know but we need America we need. We need to stand on our own two bloody two feet for a change you know sort of said where <,> you know sorry but you know this is not legal this is not moral this is uh the problem is a problem for the Middle East it was created <,> um with the Balfour resolution during the First World War. Uh it's it then it turn into lies after lies after lies until eventually um England uh wash uh their hand with uh with uh the Palestine solution and give it to the United Nation <P1 tt>. Y'know and ih <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yeah uh ih it's a lot more complex than a lotta people are suspecting and uh and ye you're right y you p really have to look at the reasons for the terrorism uh ih as potentially I guess the the the main solution. Jean Pierre thanks for y for your thoughts on it. Magpie uh consistency is your issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 42: Magpie, F] Don't you like what I put up on the board.\n",

      "[C42] <laughs> Well probably a few listeners wouldn't mind if a few black and white feathers flew but I don't think Bingar is a major target. Um H M A S Success in New Zealand <P1 mm>. Feel very sorry for the crew because I have a feeling that there's some uh uh readjustments going on in uh routines over there. But that is just how simple this sort of thing can happen <P1 mm>. Um even if they did write the right thing on the side of it. At first I don't think we have enough information exactly at this moment to to acknowledge who is behind it there may be some educated guesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well the European and Arab intelligence officials say the preliminary investigation and uh the interrogation of the five arrested <,> is really pointing heavily towards Al Qaeda.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C42] Only one of whom apparently is uh of interest the others were uh uh phone shop owners. Um I mean the for ooh I don't know there was a great organisation went on behind this incident uh the timing the the whole thing that was needed uh listening to someone there you needed to organise the uh coordinate have vehicles have <,> have h safe houses have escape routes so there was more than one involved uh it was a big organisation of some by some very clever person. Um we have been warned uh time and time again n Australia has been named um by this coalition of the willing is the alliance between the warnings and our vulnerability. Um but you see no weapons of mass destruction Tony have actually been found in Iraq which mea could be inferred that Iraq was actually complying with that U N resolution which the U S and its puppets used as an excuse to go into Iraq. So in actual fact ih it almost makes it an illegal act in itself uh after the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm <C42 y'know> well the the French and the Germans certainly thought that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C42] Well precisely um <,> now <,> Mr Howard today said it wasn't neccessary to upgrade a warning colour but several uni uni European countries have gone from yellow to orange and one's gone to red <P1 mm>. And.\n",

      "[P1] I think we were listed as being at medium level at this time.\n",

      "[C42] Well when Mr Howard was asked he said no it was not neccessary change. Alright everybody who have a fridge magnet what is the national security hotline number Tony <laughs>. It's a good trivia question 'cos no one remembers it.\n",

      "[P1] Dear oh dear <C42 laughs>. You ask you do ask the tough questions. Thanks Magpie Warren uh ye you um an L P G tanker driver.\n",

      "[Caller 43: Warren, M] Yes mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] And you've had some directives from your company.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C43] Yes I've been um we've been instructed by the company in writing as well as verbally um to be aware of what's around us we do a lotta late night deliveries.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C43] And we've been told be very careful. If we don't think it's safe to drive off. Um one of our drivers says what happens if we get confronted by people in vehicles and he won't let you drive over 'em if you have to. This is um <laughs> <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] That's interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C43] Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] A a and and what they're they're they're concerned that there is the possibility of <C43 well> somebody trying to commandeer a vehicle and and do damage with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C43] Yeah well y'know like a forty-five-thousand litre L P G tank would make a helluva big hole in the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] It would.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C43] And and um <laughs> we've been told be very careful and if we don't think it's safe to keep driving then call the authorities. Um I'm <P1 that's interesting> out at the mo I'm out at the moment working. And w y'know w w w we go to some s pretty dark and horrible places in the middle of the night. And um y'know we're we're all concerned and <laughs> even our families are concerned 'cos y'know we we've gone back to our families and said been told to do this and um <P1 that is>. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] That is really scary.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C43] Yeah well it it would make a helluva mess I can tell you now <P1 mm> it'd make a helluva mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yeah that's reason to be concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C43] 'Cos um 'cos um L P G is very very volatile even more than y'know your average unleaded fuel so uh it's <laughs>. Yeah it's a bit worrying 'n' you you might say when you're driving the thing around all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Absolutely Warren thanks for passing that on that's uh that's interesting <,> a new approach from a company when uh <,> when dealing with uh anybody who might approach an L P G tanker. Colin uh you you believe if we surrender to terror they're the winners.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 44: Colin, M] Oh of course uh you just have to have a look what's happening in Spain now <P1 mm>. Uh the terrorist there now know that they can.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Change governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C44] Government <P1 mm>. And change government policy. And how can you do it you can do it through bombs <P1 mm>. Um and that means they are now in the driving seat they are going to win this uh campaign. If the rest of us give up if the rest of us give in to them and I guess it's called a form of appeasement <P1 mm>. Um I I find that very concerning and uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] It is a very difficult task this this uh declared war on terror from president George W Bush. Uh it's simply because it's such an amorphous mass <C44 it is>. Uh it's h it's hard to know exactly where they are. Where they they thought that they knew where most of the training bases were in Afghanistan <C44 mhm>. Um I don't know whether they control much more than the Afghani capital. Uh and a and a small area around that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C44] Well the Northern Alliance scar has a large slice of northern Afghanistan and that's nominally within the control of the alliance <P1 mm>. Of of the sorry the coalition of the willing. Um uh y'know we shouldn't underestimate what has been achieved in Afghanistan certainly the <,> dreaded uh Taliban have gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Oh <C44 inaudible> no no question that uh it was good to to have them departed but <C44 and> uh y you you sort of wonder whether the American focus uh moved to Iraq and uh y'know basically let Afghanistan go.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C44] Oh true there there there's uh evidence in that I guess. Uh the point I would make though that we as a nation ha have been marked already. We were marked <,> at the time of our events in Afghanistan <,> um.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] We were also marked uh at East Timor.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C44] East Timor that's right and I would suggest that we were marked before that because <,> these people the terrorists they don't like who we are or what we stand for. And if we start surrendering and giving in to their <,> dictates their demands well they win and the world will be poorer for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Colin great to hear from you uh Eve you uh you believe we've been at war with terror for uh a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 45: Eve, F] Uh uh yes uh Tony I just heard you say before <,> well there's probably a reason for terrorism. There's no such a reason for terrorism it's a most insidious horrible thing. Now uh uh uh what that foreman meh Colin said uh uh that the new socialist government is going to appease these terrorists so that any time in the future uh any country's going to have an election they'll boh blow up a few uh trains and dictate who's going to govern the country <P1 mm>. So all your listeners who who <,> y'know it's always they get on to have this shot at John Howard anyway <,> uh th they will come on and say oh what wuh y'know we've got wuh t terrorism ih you blame the Americans you blame <,> the English and you bla blame the Australians uh uh can you remeh you wouldn't remember sixty years ago when Hitler tried to take over the world. And and Japan and our allies went and fought them otherwise Hitler wuh wuh would've taken over the whole world. You you don't give in to them Tony <P1 mm>. Now uh I I I really can't believe all these people that are blaming the coalition uh for for going to war with Iraq and and these other countries these fundamentalist Islamic terrorist <,> and y'know I I will justify which uh uh we're all required to to say not all Muslims are terrorists <,> but there's a lot of them who hate Christians. Uh the ye y'know all you people who come on and defend these people uh that uh you're getting the message aren't you that they hate Christians and we are at war with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm well I I think there's a war on terrorism I don't think there's a war against m uh uh Islam. Uh it's uh it it it is a a y'know a conflict that <,> uh is based on uh Osama Bin Laden and his uh connections that uh are determined to <,> y'know make radical changes in <C45 but Tony they're they're they're> the Middle East and America.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C45] They're promising they're going to take over the world and kill the infidels is that correct. That's a war isn't it <P1 mm>. So what do you do. Do you just sit back and let them take over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yes I I think that uh y'know th they can disrupt the world I don't think they can take over the world it's not it's not like they've got an army like uh Adolf Hitler had behind him and y'know the he had the potential to take over the world. And I think y'know this is a group that can rock the world certainly but not uh not not uh uh y'know dem uh commandeer us.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C45] Any anyway Tony I I'm I'm just <,> uh fearful of the people that we now have in Australia <,> who've just uh wih wih with their provincial political thinking blame everything on John Howard I think he's a very brave man. Uh who has taken on these terrorists like two-hundred Australians uh uh were blown up three-thousand Americans were blown up uh two hundred uh uh Spanish people were blown up the other day so what do we do. Do we appease them or do we go to war against terrorism <P1 is>. I think that's the main question people should be asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Thanks very much for your point of view uh Dawn you you believe the prime minister's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 46: Dawn, F] Yes I do and I'm so pleased to hear Colin and Eve thinking correctly. I n I know for one that I don't want to have to walk down the street wheeling my grandchild thinking can't I take him in there or can't I take him there. I wanna enjoy his time with me while I'm alive <P1 mm> and I and my grandchildren to come and as as far as defending Australia I think people are are it amazed me I they're the <,> the islalelu {Islamic} the Islamic race is winning. Uh they they have already won it is a war terrorism is a war and they're they're already winning they do have the means <,> you say they can't take over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well I mean th they doh they don't have the means to to y'know dominate the world at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C46] Well sneaking into places and bombing bombing innocent people <,> blowing hundreds of people up at a time I mean <P1 mhm> that's good odds isn't it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yeah well it certainly rocks the world there is no question of it and I mean everybody is firmly focussed on what happened in Spain I mean uh ih it was terrible I mean these people were uh poor workers they were uh y'know um uh students they were every everyday average people who were <C46 that's what I mean> who were killed by this uh <C46 that's what I mean Tony> terrorist outrage.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C46] Can you think of a place in Australia where they couldn't get to. You could you think of place in Australia that's safe. And what if they were so well organised that they could choo asy as a caller previously said uh they could use telephones to ignite these bombs from long distances away. I mean they could do twenty thirty places at a time <P1 mm>. It must have taken a lot of organisation for those people to get the planes to work in places where they could be trusted y'know in America and then all of a sudden that great disaster I mean there were thousands killed there. And those people were going into people's homes as friends <P1 mm>. I I can't believe that people can be so naive <,> as n as I mean I look at it almost as treason when you go against your own country and I think John Howard is a is a very brave man and I think we've got the right man at the helm he <,> nothing rocks him where he can think he can think evenly about things every every problem that's thrown at him in this situation he's very s he's a steadfast person he stands stands there <P1 mm> and protects our country and and makes decisions that that affect us every day that keep us safe. Uh I I think people are are choosing a game of dice they're throwing it in the air and saying yes we'll choose this it's like barracking for a football team. They get a they get an idea into their head and they think oh yeah this is good this'll be good but not one of those people would be willing to say <,> I bet you if he said come on stand up with me and protect our country they wouldn't. I have a son who's just come out of the army he's now in the police force and he was overseas. And I I dread to think I have another son as well that they would stand up there and protect people like these. And what would they do what would they have done if they had've if there had've been and I still believe there were weapons somewhere I believe that he had a l it's a huge place over there and he had a lotta countries <,> as allies to put those weapons long long ago uh otherwise why wouldn't he let them come in straight away and look.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Alright Dawn thanks for that uh good to hear from you James you you believe that fear is taking over uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 47: James, M] <inaudible> g'day mate um good conversation tonight. Yeah I was in England got back just over a year ago <P1 mhmm> on a working holiday visiting relatives. Caught the tube from Padding to Waterloo 'n' <P1 yep> mate I hated it <laughs> it was awful <laughs>. And it wasn't me and and um one thing I learned and my family and friends told me is that <,> people weren't very friendly and people don't say hello and I just hate the idea that 'cos I grew up in Sydney. I just hate the idea that it's gunna become like that 'cos I remember Sydney as a happy friendly city and <,> people say g'day y'know just <,> just and then they're achieving what they want to achieve just just by that and I just hope that it doesn't become that way because I thought it was awful. And I found myself becoming that way. I'd see a bag a bag or baggage on the train and no one near it. Y'know.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] You'd move away.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C47] And I'd go uhp <P1 mm> no I wouldn't I'd go who's that belong to <laughs>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Oh okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C47] Where's that come from <P1 yeah> and I'd I'd watch it. And and all the warnings and the and the alerts over the over the network and and the voice overs and things and it does get to you and I just <P1 mm> hate to think that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] I mean ih ih terrorism isn't brand new here either I mean we y you only have to think back to uh what was it nineteen-seventy-eight the CHOGM conference at the Hilton hotel in Sydney. The <C47 yeah> the bomb that went off outside of the Hilton <C47 yeah>. Um so it's it's and y'know we've we've had an explosion at uh the police <C47 inaudible> headquarters in in Adelaide we've had uh <C47 yeah> the uh y'know and and Bali o obviously even though it wasn't <C47 and Bali yeah> on Australian territory it was almost de facto Australian territory.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C47] It was yeah yeah. I I just I just don't like the the idea that that we might become very unfriendly people and suspicious and a bit paranoid about <,> where we go and what we do and I just hope it doesn't become that way 'cos that's what I experienced in England and I didn't like it at all basically <laughs>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yeah I know I I understand exactly what you're saying James thanks uh Steve you you're concerned about the increased powers issue you have a bit of a problem with uh unlimited powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 48: Steve, M] Yes very much so actually soon I'll be more scared of uh uh t uh the police than the terrorists <P1 mm>. Because um if they suddenly have powers holding you without arrest and all of that it um <,> takes off uh the pressure on the police to actually uh be a bit more um thorough in their investigation. They can just hold you because oh you look like a terrorist and suddenly um you could be in their custody for a period of time which can affect uh your family life <P1 mm> once I find that you are in custody you uh tend to um uh you you feel that you're powerless and uh with uh with them being able to say well you can come here and uh we don't ha even have to charge you with anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm I don't think they're thinking about uh a replica of Guantanamo Bay I don't think it's gunna be quite that ruthless but uh what they're saying is that what they'd need to do probably is hold <,> uh terror suspects for longer than we would normally hold criminal suspects for and be able to investigate them fully otherwise uh y'know it is it's it's possible that the authorities are gunna miss certain facts uh that could be critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C48] I've no problems there but these laws seems to be uh cutting across the whole board whole spectrum <P1 mm> so therefore I mean yes that might be a good law for today and everybody sort of understands but suddenly <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] It's on the books and so therefore it's there forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C48] That's right and therefore some policeman may have a small grudge against you maybe nothing major but suddenly he holds you for four hours or how many hours he's allowed to hold you whatever the case may be. It's just something and then lets you go you've got no recourse unless you've got good lawyers <P1 laughs>. And um <laughs> y'know money y'know you let these things go and I find that there should be I mean I I believe they should have powers and I believe they have a lot of powers. Mm but I think there there's gotta be a very tight scrutiny and like the last uh powers that were introduced with ASEO the only people that really scrutinised them were the Greens and at the end of the whole lot I actually wasn't quite satisfied um where the powers would end and and and I wasn't clear where what the powers actually were <P1 yeah>. And that's uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] So you the you you think it's important to underline the fact that it's still a democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C48] Yes very much so and uh I believe they do have uh quite extensive powers now and just by giving more and more powers to the police actually creates more fear of the police than it does of the terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Alright Steve thanks for your view Greg you uh have a general comment on on terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 49: Greg, M] Yes uh Tony.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] G'day Greg.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C49] I I was very impressed with the comments of uh Colin Steve and that other lady uh we're talking here raw patriotism and uh and I'm not taking away from the others who have a genuine belief in what they believe in they they believe in appeasement and so on. But my attitude is I go though a path and when I walk through Perth I I go through a sign that says those deserve peace who are prepared to defend it. Now that doesn't mean to say that I'm a warmonger <P1 mm>. What I'm saying is if someone threatens my country I'm a defensive person not an offensive person <P1 yep> if someone threatens my country I'm right behind whichever political party is prepared to pick up the gear and go and I will do that I'll defend Bob Brown I'll say Bob righto Bob you wouldn't wanna pick up a a an M sixteen with me. I've gotta defend you and your family and you're gunna roll over uh and say y'know please don't hurt me it's uh ih uh I'm a good bloke. I said that that isn't the way these poor fanatics think <P1 mm>. And I said the bottom line is that that sort of action those guys have got and they are fanatics and they are off the beam and <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well ih it makes it also very hard to defend against simply because you don't know exactly where they're going to go next.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C49] No and and of course if if they come into our territory any of these folks that do that then I say we need whatever powers that the government needs to defend against that I am only too happy to support it because I can walk through. They can arrest me any time they want to. I can walk through there I know that I will come out the other end okay. Now some of those blokes are a little worried about that. Think about it because um uh in our judicial system ih in the Westminster system of government we have a predication of innocence before guilt <P1 mm> and uh I uh I uh I think I couldn't put it better than Colin Eve and that other lady <P1 yep>. And I won't try and go over that ground again Tony.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] But uh as far as you're concerned <C49 inaudible> we we we should uh.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C49] <inaudible> protecting my country and my family and <P1 yeah> my grandkids.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Y you believe we should be taking a a very aggressive uh investigative.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C49] <inaudible> it's not so much aggressive but a very positive stance towards protecting our country and we don't roll over and just lie down and go for appeasement. That's not my game and I I will support any government and I guarantee there's an awful lotta people behind me <,> that that says we will use whatever powers we have to to protect our kith and kin.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Tt good to hear from you Greg thanks for that uh Tom you you believe public gatherings <,> could be a possible target here.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 50: Tom, M] Yes Tony. I just listened to that man and a couple of women before him <,> and I wonder where they live. Um <,> here in Toowoomba I I doubt that we've got any cause to worry because there are no gatherings big enough anywhere in toowoom {Toowoomba} we don't have a train service <P1 mm>. Sydney and Melbourne could be concerned about it but why about transport when they have for instance in Melbourne they have an anything up to ninety-thousand people gathered together for a game of football.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Mm oh it's something we have to look at too I mean <C50 of course> y'know major sporting gatherings that sort of thing it ih y'know they all could be potential targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C50] But how do you guard against people who are prepared to blow themselves to pieces to take somebody else with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well I don't think you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C50] And I heard I heard a a few of your callers talking about <,> them the terrorists have done this to these innocent people in Spain. What the hell do they think that the coalition of the willing did <,> to innocent people in Afghanistan and and Iraq <P1 mm>. Y'know and and as one of your callers said <,> nobody is dib is being bothered to find out why they are terrorists why they are doing this sorta stuff. How can you defeat something if you don't know why they're doing it <P1 mm>. And and when they talk about a war against terrorism <,> you you can't win a war against terrorism you have to find some other way of doing it. And that doesn't mean rolling over and appeasement and all the rest of it. And uh I don't know where they get the idea that <,> um Bob Brown or Labor is prepared to roll over and and and appease the terrorists uh uh it's all I I I don't know I don't know where they <,> <sigh> they they must just reach up into the m into into air and grab these things out out of mid air because.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] A l a lotta people believe that um y'know we shouldn't have been in Iraq in the first place <C50 of course> uh and and I think um y'know that's th th that's the attitude that they're reflecting.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "[P1] So first to you all the great mystery of this campaign for us what would Jesus do. Paul Newsham let me come to you first. Um <,> Christians seem to be getting organised <,> in political lobbies in a way that they haven't in previous election campaigns. Now is this something that has just spilled over from the United States or has there been a groundswell for a number of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] I think it's been growing for a number of years I I think Christians um have withdrawn from politics for too long um and from from making their voice heard probably because we felt being in a Christian nation that our values were being maintained but I I think as we look now at our nation we probably would be hard pressed to call it Christian and I think our Christian values have also been undermined quite dramatically so Christians are just rising up and saying we want to have the values that we believe in.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well I guess the real question there then comes to be well there's two questions that occur to me <,> why in organised parties and uh what values. Let's address the organised parties question first and uh Brian <,>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Now.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] There's a long history of Christian involvement with uh with with politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Why uh what's the difference between Christians who get into politics just by becoming members of other parties and this current trend to see Christians particularly it seems to me <E1 mm> and I may be wrong uh Christians with a a particularly tight view on on social issues <E1 yes> getting organised in politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yes yes well ih yes uh Christians uh I I think at the moment are involved ih in in both levels very much uh there are those that are uh forming parties and and coalescing in that way. Um ih it's perhaps not so obvious that there uh are uh and have been for a long time a lot of Christians who are uh deeply involved in uh uh in politics but but not in in uh sort of that cohesive way it's uh it's Christians working within other parties. Uh and I think to some extent there are some uh uh sort of theological things that underlie why why people take a different approach to that <,> um ih it's possibly true that th perhaps the more conservative people do tend to to form parties a little bit more and I think it's possibly because of a slightly different view of the world. Um perhaps uh they see things a little bit more black and white and and perhaps the idea of uh of being uh separated from the world is perhaps a little bit a little bit stronger and so in a sense a a slightly different view of holiness of uh of working in a in a Christian community and not sort of being <,> unequally yoked with uh with people in uh in secular parties uh whereas on the other side there are there are people who would suggest that uh uh the best way to transform structures is by actually being involved in those structures and so try and work within uh political parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Victoria Kearney let me bring you in here because there is a long history of Catholic social involvement with the community indeed <,> uh the church has been actively seen particularly in Europe uh over the last hundred years or so has been actively involved in uh creating political parties. Yet that seemed to go on the wane over recent years and you have more the tendency s uh uh to do as as Brian was describing for Catholics to get involved in parties and be the sort of influence within existing parties. Why has that happened what's been the shift there.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] I think that um <,> there there was th there was the argument between religion and politics and I think that people have uh probably taken a step back in terms of being involved in party politics <,> but our organisation is actually coming back into the political arena because they've recognised that they can work like a revolving door around poverty and welfare and structural problems <,> unless they actually get into the part t into the political arena they won't impact on that on those policy issues so we're coming back into politics but fo.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] But not as a party.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Not as a party but as a ih on in relation to the policies themselves.\n",

      "[P1] Issue by issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Paul that comes back to you then <E3 mm> why have you been an active supporter of getting Christians as organised groups to form political parties uh Family First is one party that you've been associated with being active in support of and I know that Family First has a lot of support in A O G Assemblies of God communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Yeah I think I think John it has to be said that we've been active in getting people involved at all levels both the levels that have been talked about in the sense of uh people becoming actively involved in other <,> um parties uh getting involved in the political system p uh uh per se uh but also there's been this move in more recent times to get involved in uh a party as such. Um I I think it has to be said that Family First doesn't see themselves as a Christian party but uh certainly the majority of the people in there are Christian. But they're espousing the kind of vows uh views rather that Christians um of our type would be more likely to espouse I <,> I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] What do you mean by your type.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Well <,> probably those of us who are strongly uh for family values and so on who have been I think um disappointed with the standards and the directions that some of the parties have been going <,> we.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Which parties in particular.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Oh <several laugh>. Well y'know I I don't think any of the parties have specifically d uh targeted families as someone that they're concerned for. Um every party kind of has its um its group y'know the Labor party have uh targeted the working class the Liberals more the business <,> uh the Greens the environmentalists and so on. Um Family First party and others like them have felt that the family is someone who needs to be very much cared for and <,> it doesn't become a single issue in the sense that every piece of legislation just about that goes through any parliament is going to affect the family in some way and so <,> it's been felt by these people that family needs that kind of protection and and and I think that those people that are supporting parties such as Family First and others are very very strong that the family is the basic unit of society and that w if that goes down society goes down. So.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Brian Edgar let <inaudible> <E1 yeah> I'll have <E1 well> to get in on that <inaudible> <E1 yeah I> we can't let you <E2 and E1 laugh> run a party political ad here.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I think I think this is actually another reason uh for why some Christians prefer to work in parties in that way Paul's pointed us to this <,> that that there are some for s from some people's point of view uh there are some certain specific issues that they say would say these are definitively the issues that uh that Christians need to get involved in and we can agree on those issues <,> whereas I think some of the Christians who uh don't get involved uh in in a a a Christian party in th in that sense or ih or a party of Christians <,> uh perhaps see that there are there are other issues as well I'm not suggesting that Family First are not concerned about issues of asylum seekers or justice or the war in Iraq or so on. But uh th the it seems that that the formal sort of more Christian parties ha have nominated uh largely family issues uh uh as as being the focus whereas those that are working through other parties are perhaps more <,> uh more focused on on some other issues or perhaps PolMin and others uh are more <,> y'know <,> based on specific policy issues rather than uh a a a party structure like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well l let's come to the point there and shift away from the the issue of how we organise in parties and come to that question of values. That is what are definitively Christian values that one could claim uh uh a mandate for in terms of going to people and saying look these are the values that Jesus would stand for this is what Jesus would vote on. Um for you Victoria Kearney what are the critical issues as a committed Catholic Christian that you say look Jesus would be right down the line one these.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Okay I just wanted to make the point that PolMin has been very successful <,> having a bipartisan party political position. We've actually um reflected other people's positions and sharing sh recognising that we're actually sharing values across party positions. So that's where PolMin has made a difference particularly in say the water issue. But in terms of Jesus in terms of what the what the values that we operate on are the common good. The the the fact that it is the concept that is the cornerso cornerstone of Catholic social teaching. It says that all social conditions everybody should have access to equal social conditions. People.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Equity then is it is it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Equity and and and equity in terms of fulfilment um fulfilment to the resources of creation fulfilment in terms of housing fulfilment in terms of uh education. So the com common good is one of the very strong cornerstones of our work. Um solidarity with those who are disenfranchised. If we don't protect the rights of the poor or the disenfranchised it affects all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Now you're picking up on a strand of Catholic social teaching that's been there for the best part of what a hundred and ten years now <E2 yes> since uh the famous um uh the famous uh w work uh by pope um tt.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] John <P1 by by by> John.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well not John the twenty-third <E2 oh yeah> but I'm going back a hundred years before that <E2 yes>. Um <,> uh to to the whole issue of Catholic social teaching and uh um the condition of the the working classes that er document <E2 that's right> that came out in eighteen-ninety um so the.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] You probably know more about the the the specifics of cashel Catholic social teaching than I do but what you're talking about is solidarity with those who are um not a y'know not disenfranchised and and s the the whole mutuality if we do for them we do for us it's a reciprocal arrangement it's it's for the for the good of all that we pull together. And so they they would be some of the values that we'd be looking at.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Alright now Brian w what for you <E1 yeah> you're you're coming as a director of theology and public policy from a group called the Evangelical Alliance which is a an umbrella body for a number <E1 that's right> of of mainline protestant groups <E1 yes> I guess we could d describe <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yes we're we're not we're not in any sense a political party I mean we see uh people being involved uh in all sorts of uh different kinds of ways. I I I think some of the values that uh Christians have traditionally seen as y'know Christian values and and people have applied in their own lives <,> are actually really important social values that need to be expressed in terms that are appropriate for our community <,> take something like grace y'know a a y'know amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like ne me is normally seen as being something that applies uh to us the God has uh saved us by his grace but if grace was lived out as a a social value it would be profound because grace really means giving people what they don't deserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yes you've picked an <E1 uh> interesting example there uh with uh Amazing Grace written by John Newton <E1 mm> who was a converted slave trader of course who fought <E1 yes > for the abolition of slavery <E1 a and was very political> so grace for him was a social value.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yes <E2 mm> that's right and uh uh uh had profound uh impact uh uh I might have mentioned th mentioned this to you earlier profound impact actually directly on Australian there's a direct line <,> between um John Newton and William Wilberforce uh in the in England Wilberforce uh was advised by Newton <,> not to give up politics uh Wilberforce was planning to go into the ministry and Newton said no don't go <,> do that y stay in politics and and Wilberforce uh mixed with William Pitt the prime minister then and it was at a a breakfast between uh Wilberforce and Pitt that they decided to send uh a chaplain out to the Botany Bay to the colonies here. So sort of direct straight line between John Newton and uh and Australia here.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] And and you say that that really defines a tradition within evangelical protestantism.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Certainly. There has been a very strong tradition uh of soh social involvement in evangelicals I think unfortunately during the <,> twentieth century uh it slipped away. The n the nineteenth century was a tremendous time for for evangelicals in terms of social action and the twentieth century perhaps wasn't so hot 'cos I think a lot of evangelicals bought into the <,> sort of claim that there's a dichotomy a division between faith and work uh and and tended to privatise faith a lot but <,> uh part of the reason I think why in recent times there's been a lot more political involvement is that people are overcoming that very artificial distinction <,> uh that there's private faith and public values and people saying well look these <,> these values these Christian values that we have they're actually very important social values as well. I mean if we didn't have a society that was based on giving people more than they deserved how would that change our our attitudes in terms of uh the way we deal with uh with social welfare the way that we deal with uh asylum seekers and so on ih could would be quite radical.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Uh Paul what Brian is saying there is picking up on much of what you said but I suspect you're coming from act actually radically different positions when you're looking at application of those values.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Yeah I'm not so sure um first of all y'know I don't represent a political party I believe that any candidate who's upholding Christian values is really worthy of a a vote. Um I I I think that for me whether you believe we're a trichotomy a dichotomy or any other kind of otomy <E2 laughs> um every area of our life is affected by our spiritual beliefs just as every <,> just as our spiritual beliefs affect every area of our are affected by every area of our lives. And so I think when it comes to our beliefs in politics and so on we need to be um bringing those values in but for me I'm very interested and I'm sure that <,> that the people that I've associated with in the past and and m candidates that have Christian values are very interested in the health of our people we we want our nation to have good health cover and good health protection we we want good education systems in our country and surely every <P1 uh> Australian wants that.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well let's talk about education 'cos there's a there's a really interesting issue. I um wuh y you support I would take it the um the uh the the position on on private schools that private schools should be um should be actively supported and that Christian schools should be actively supported.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Y yes I would because I think that if parents choose that form of education for their children then they should be able to do that. I think it's.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] What if about that choice isn't economically available to them. That is I'm talking about where you get a situation where you've got to say as the churches did in debating this a hundred years ago <,> look if we privatised education we wouldn't have an adequate public system. So we've gotta have the public system first.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Y yeah and and I acs fully accept that argument and I'm not gunna go against that I think however that part of the choice that parents make is whether or not they can afford a private education and many <,> many private schools of course do everything they can to help families that are underprivileged so that their children can still have some level of education in a private school. Um but to me it is a choice of parents and I think that it's also a good thing that governments support uh public uh private education as well as public education I don't think there should be competition here I think they should be working together but let's not forget that the parents who are putting their children into public s uh into private schools are still paying taxes as the s th under the same regime and to the same value as those that are in public school I I really don't think it should be a major issue. I think it again we should be making sure that our children are getting a good education whether they're in a private or a public school.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Brian\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yes well uh uhf have to say of this point say the Evangelical Alliance wouldn't have a a specific policy on that but it would be uh I think guided uh along lines of a a say if uh the principles of justice. Uh and biblicly speaking justice is a is a concept that's biased uh in favour of the disadvantaged so uh whatever policy one comes out with there it it needs to be uh a policy that works in favour of those who are most disadvantaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] And Victoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Uh PolMin would probably support that s a similar position that we need to protect the rights of those who are disen disenfranchised. So we need to have access for the poor to education and then choice for those who wanna make a choice.\n",

      "[E2] Is this capitalism or is this democracy and this is greed y'know I think his first reaction might have been quite angry. But I think he might have thought about the donkey vote y'know he was inseparable with his donkey wasn't he <laughs>. But I think he would've given it a lotta thought after a while and started to think about the values a little bit more you know and <,> and what what it was that. I think he would have cast a vote eventually.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Paul <E3 yeah> let me ask you a question here. Uh you mentioned um t the family values up front and ih you've we mentioned your association with the Family First party. What ih <,> wh what is it that makes you associate Jesus in particular with family values.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Well let me say first of all uh to Damian y'know his comment about us not getting our tongue around Christian values. Uh to me it's very very important that we recognise that righteousness exalts a nation economy and things like that don't but righteousness do that's that's a straight outta the bible statement and I'm a <,> a unashamed bible believer. Um tt what ih what makes me associate with family values is that what you said.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] W no what makes you particularly associate Jesus with family <E3 okay> values.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Well I I I just see um Jesus and the teachings of his disciples for example the apostle Paul are very strong on family values uh y'know particularly you go into Ephesians five and so on. Y you just see the power of family in the teachings there. I think Jesus valued families greatly he valued individuals as well of course and and when we talk families I don't think we just wanna talk about the nuclear family or the husband wife and two kids I think the single mum with two or three children and <,> a and so on are are family. And because they are individuals uh but because God created family in the first place he has a very deep interest in them but I come back again to the fact that to my understanding family is the basic unit of society. When God created Adam he then created Eve and he put them together on the face of the earth to work together and I don't think that's ever changed. I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well it's it's interesting because when you look at the actually the way Jesus behaved it was actually different to that. You could I mean I'm not denying what you're saying but one could equally if one was getting into a bit of <,> biblical exegesis as they call it explaining the bible and unpacking it. Y you could actually build a case to say that Jesus was highly anti family in a way. That he actually never got married himself that he went out on the road <,> that Paul was anti family that Paul said look d only get married if you <,> if you if you have to y'know there is a better way in fact the church dev uh valued the idea of the single life very much that that this whole building of the family values thing is a really artificial construction that's not to say it's it's it's wrong it may be right but you could equally <E3 uh> build a <E3 uh uh> build a case the other way could you not.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] I think if you if you go through the teachings of Jesus he made statements about family and marriage and how sacred marriage was and a sexual relationship the whole thing so I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yes but did he make it pre-eminent I guess is what I'm saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well if I if I.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Brian <E2 sighs>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I d I don't think it's ei it's one or the other I uh uh wuh uh. I think evangelicals generally would want to have pretty strong stratements {statements} on the on the family side and on the justice side I think part of the problem <E3 absolutely> has been these two things have been <,> separated uh too much uh. Somebody looked at our our website during the week and thought we were a bit left. Uh but I think that's only because perhaps they had identified the Christian issues with one side that is the family issues and type of thing which we have statements about uh but anybody who had statements about some of the other issues is obviously left now I think it's a matter <,> we have s <,>  y'know it's important to have uh from our point of view yuh statements about uh family uh marriage uh uh same sex relationships views views about that as well as uh the justice issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Absolutely I <E2 I think mm> I.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Paul hang on we'll get Victoria in.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Yeah just I just think that Damian made the point about private morality public morality and I think that <,> in some ways Jesus was a collectivist in that and a communal person because he stood in solidarity with the poor he was seen in groups um he was listening to one group versus the other group so <,> there he had a public role and a private role in terms of his morality and his failures so.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Let's take some more calls Damian thanks for your call we're gunna have to move on <,> to uh to Bernard in in Melbourne hello Bernard how are you.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 2: Bernard, M] Good evening. Um I'm concerned that uh some of your panel tonight is doing much the same branding that the political parties themselves do. Um to talk about uh evangelism as being on about the family and yet uh the evangelical movement is often <,> uh vehemently anti same sex relationships and uh glorifying material wealth and material success seems to me is very much anti family <,> and to talk about the Catholic church as being honour bound uh to common good and justice <,> when as a Catholic I have to say that the internal administration of the Catholic church resembles farm more Stalinist uh Soviet Union than it does <,> the mercifulness and forgiveness and compassion of Jesus um really means that br a brand a particular brand is being put forward rather than the truth and in that way resembles the uh the major parties much more than it does the uh simple humble merciful and loving message that Jesus gave.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] I think we'd get Victoria to respond to that Victoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Okay um I'd like <P1 thanks Bernard> I'd like to just say that PolMin is not part of the mainstream church. Um we have members who are c obviously Catholics and and our teaching is Catholic but we're we're definitely an independent Catholic lobby organisation which which I guess <,> um entitles us to our own position whi which doesn't neccessarily reflect the the mainstream of the church.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Are you suggesting you have some sympathy with with what Bernard's saying about the institutional church <E2 that's right> er as as religion <E2 mm> with a capital R <E2 mm>. Mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] I means our bishop in in Parramatta came out last week and talked about public morality in voting. Now we would definitely support that and be very proud of the fact that Bishop Manning said that <,> and we would say that publicly but that doesn't neccessarily mean that <,> uh PolMin is an independent organisation from the mainstream of of the structure of the church in Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Brian the church does have a bit to answer for as an institution uh be it all all the denominations uh <E1 mhm> how does one respond to that do you actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well yes I I think in general the the the point that's made there is is uh one about humility y'know uh who who does speak for God and and do we speak <,> too decisively uh and the Church probably well cer certainly has at times uh spoken too decisively about uh y'know saying what what God wants and I think we have to uh be very humble in uh in speaking for God but <,> in a sense not speaking is uh is worse we have to <,> uh s do and say what we can but recognising w we we don't have the full truth and ih indeed that's actually what lies behind say the um the doctrine of the separation of church and state <,> uh which is as much a theological as a political doctrine which is saying look there is a certain danger <,> in in the church trying to pretend that it has all knowledge and can definitively say what what God wants. Um.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Is that the danger of the church become like a political party because it could <E1 it is> achieve government and then be in the position of being both Caesar <E1 yes> and Christ.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Yes there there's there is a t a significant distinction between the separation of church and state which I think is very important doctrine <,> and the uh separation of Christians and politics now I think Christians should be involved in politics and I don't think they should be separated but they<,> at the formal level of church and state it's uh it's a dangerous thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Let's move on to uh to Pam in Melbourne hello Pam welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 3: Pam, F] Hello how <P1 wh> are you.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Good what would you like to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C3] Well I'd I think that he would be he would vote for an environmental party because I think we'll all have to answer for what we've done to the creation. And that he would be a socialist because of the values of sharing having enough but not being greedy having compassion being honest and having a stewardship.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Okay Ralph we'll get you to uh sorry we'll get you to respond to that now p Paul rather.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Um I I'm quite that Jesus would be very interested in the environment and very concerned for it and I'm I'm absolutely certain that his values include sharing and so on. I'm not sure whether he would fit into an environmentalist party or a socialist party but I do think that Jesus Christ would vote if he were going to vote and by the way voting is secret in our country so he probably wouldn't ever tell us. Um <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Wh why do you say though you don't think he fit into an environmentalist or a socialist <E3 no> party.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] No I'm saying I'm not sure if he would and I'm not sure where he would throw his persuasion in fact because Jesus would be wanting to see the whole of our society helped and strengthened um and so I think he'd be looking for the opportunity to help in every one of those areas and probably find that each one of the parties fell short in one area. Um for example if he went to an environmental party he might find that there are things in there he didn't like and so he'll go then looking for somewh I don't there's just no perfect <E1 mm> party is there.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] I think that's ih if I can say I think that's laid behind my slightly uh cynical comment before that Jesus was a m might be a swinging voter <E3 yes>. It's just because it's a little difficult to imagine him saying well <,> uh look it's all the way with the Liberals or it's it's I'm a dyed in the wool Labor Labor person <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] But surely that's what parties like the Christian Democratic party are doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Uh well I'd even say look we we y'know that they're the same kind of issues will arise there Christians themselves are not entirely agreed about what Christian values involve so <,> I I I don't here in Australia I don't eeh I I don't think I've heard <,> Christian Democrats saying oh look uh <,> uh this is the only party that somebody uh could possibly vote for I th uh there's more of that in the U S but I think I think we're a little more laid back in Australia <P1 mm>. Uh I have had some peoples tell me <,> uh in the last couple of weeks who who uh who Jesus would not vote for <,> uh or come pretty close to it but I haven't heard too many people say well <,> he would only vote for this or that uh party.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Let's go to uh to Mark in the Blue Mountains Pam thanks for your call Mark hi how are you.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 4: Mark, M] Hi good thanks good. Look I I think Jesus would definitely vote I think he would be a social activist I also think he'd be politically very concerned about issues of health education affordable housing and also um work places that offered safety and and and a bit of security and justice. I think he'd be very concerned about contemporary issues of that affect politics of today I I don't <,> I I wouldn't see him being aligned to uh conservative politics at all I think I think that would be quite alien.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] You see that that makes my point about people being more clear about who he wouldn't vote for than the than the who he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C4] Maybe so.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Uh ih Mark had you finished your uh your your delineation there.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C4] Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Well we we'll might get another couple of calls in and then come back for some uh some general comments 'cos we've got lots of people calling in <,> with some opinions on this thanks Mark for your uh for your observations. To Michael in Rooty Hill hello Michael what would you like to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 5: Michael, M] How you going. Yeah I I um I I really can't say what I think the Lord would who who who who he'd vote for but I <,> I I would like to say this that uh w one time he spoke to a um a lawyer who had a y'know the correct theological answer. But uh the Lord pointed out the the missing ingredient which was compassion. And I believe that uh y'know a lot of <,> Christian politicians and y'know the people that y'know standing up for family values et cetera yeah are doing the the right thing y'know but but we must not miss miss the compassion part. And and by compassion I don't mean y'know watering down values but I mean y'know being conscious of uh y'know certain issues like uh y'know we had the <,> the asylum seekers at one stage y'know and uh and y sometimes y'know we we can close our hearts and our ears because we're so busy just y'know doing what what we ough what we oughta do but sometimes we we miss out <,> the ingredient that that has to fit in as well. And I think um y'know there are <,> certain <,> Christian groups that that are trying to find a balance and and that's that's where I'd like to um y'know I I mean I I I I do have in mind who I'd like to vote for. Uh and han han an and and comes close to that but um yeah that's ih it's just finding the balance of <,> of of having the the Christian morals and and the principles which you can't water down but but also having the compassion that comes with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for that observation <E1 yes> Michael uh who'd like to pick that up Brian you were wanting to say something.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well yes I think I think that Michael's got a good point there uh y'know pointing us towards those values again uh uh uh at the end of the day God is not going to say uh hey did you get an annual growth rate of six percent. He's gunna say did you uh do justly did you love mercy did you show compassion did you walk humbly with God those those are the things that <,> we're gunna be asked about.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] I fully agree with that John and I uh as I've talked with politicians across the board I find some that are moved with compassion 'n' some that aren't and and that's across the board and I I really do think that it all goes back to motive in many ways why are we in there and <,> and what is our purpose for being there compassion is without a doubt very important 'n' and I ih going back to the asylum seekers which the caller mentioned um I I think if our if we weren't moved with compassion on that one we really need a needed to go back and have a look at our motives. Jesus certainly would have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Mm I think I think um y'know in terms of s Mary Magdalene was a prostitute he stood he stood beside her and and saw that her position in society was not just as a result of her personal choice. She nee y'know in terms of access to education in terms of having ih empowering people to live their lives fully I think that's what he would've he would've seen as a priority. And I think that we're getting caught up in um a few extra dollars in our pocket. Will those few extra dollars change society as a whole <E3 mhm> for all of us and I think that we need to look beyond just the the short term economic gain and look at how we can empower ourselves as a society as a whole <E3 yeah>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Let's go to uh to Caleb at the uh at the Twelve Apostles hello Caleb.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Caller 6: Caleb, M] How are you tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Yeah a very significant place to preach from tonight what would you like to say <E2 laughs>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C6] Yes that's right um tonight at church we had a friend who's children um h do home schooling and he's um the principal brought out about um the gay marriages been um going for a w while and they got t together with the prime minister and he's like said he's not going to let that happen which was really good and all the Christians got together and um and which I was really pleased to hear it um read out tonight and with their um thing you're talking about the families 'n' everything um. I just just don't know why this day and age all the families like they can't won't that they'll get married sorta thing and not live with each other and I mean Christ wouldn't want that to happen down on earth and that sorta thing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Okay well we got uh thuh. Victoria that's tends to be a little ag leaning the other way from what you're saying I mean you gave the illustration of of Christ and the woman caught in adultery and others <E2 mm mm>. Whereas our caller was saying well look you know on the gay marriage thing Jesus'd say no.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Mm I think I think Jesus supported diversity I I think he understood um why people in society who are poor did the things they did or <,> resorted to and we have the same very similar things that are happening today. Um y'know we look at even security and say terrorism. Is terrorism based on the result of corruption and poverty and fear y'know I mean people I think Jesus would see why these things are happening in our world why and h I think he would be saying look the U N's really important. Y'know we need to work this out cooperatively and rather than y'know.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] He was a globalist.\n",
      "\n",
      "[C6] Yes and rather than a blame game y'know like these people are dreadful and it's evil I think he would be saying um let's look at the causes let's work together to sort the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] We've got.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Although I agree with although I agree with that comment I think we can't uh lose sight of the fact that Jesus did make very definitive statements about things and the woman taken in adultery he didn't just say poor lady. Although he had incredible compassion for her and I trust that we will but he actually said don't do it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Did he help her out of her hole though.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Absolutely she would've been a changed woman <E2 yes>. But she was empowered to go away and not do it anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] And I think that that's what the common good says is that you provide opportunities so people can change not just say that if you work hard and and your you'll find your way out of that hole I think sometimes we need to actually support those who are not able.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] Absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Why is it um Paul do you think that currently the overt appeal in terms of politicians <,> going for the Christian vote has tended to be focussed almost directly on the appeal to the conservative side of Christianity with with um clearly Peter Costello and Tony Abbott making direct appeals for what they see as Christians who share conservative values. It's almost as though y'know Jesus would vote this way from their perspective <E3 well uh>. Why does that have such a resonance for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E3] I I think part of it is because they have noticed in recent years that the Christians are standing up and saying that we want change and we want things to be the way we believe they should and so for example I was in the meeting where uh Peter Costello spoke to Hillsong um there was something like twenty-one-thousand people present now that's a pretty good place to make your speech. Um now I'm not being totally cynical but I do think that they have realised that the <,> the the Christians are beginning to rise up and have a voice and so.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] But on the f by the same token we've only got a few minutes sorry to cut you off only got a minute or so left. In the Labor party you have people who are just as publicly Christian people like <E3 yep> Beazley reverend <E3 yep> Brian Howard deputy prime minister an <E3 yes> ordained minister <E3 yes> Michael Tate now a <E3 yep> Catholic priest <E3 mhm> um Simon Crean uh these are people who are are overt in their Christian resonance yet um uh Brian Edgar they don't seem to <inaudible>.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E1] Well I think part of it is that that the um <,> uh is that it is the the the evangelical or the or the conservative ends th the where the churches are growing that's where where a lot of the people are at I think that's uh probably part of part of the issue. But it is interesting at the end of the day that Christians tend not to vote terribly differently in terms of proportions to the rest of the population. So they're there voting for for Labor and the and the other parties as well there's not a radical difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Final word Victoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] I'd I'd I'd yes I'd I'd like to just say that I think there's a difference between spirituality and Christian perspective and theh <,> there is a very strong growth in in spirituality that is progressive in its view.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] And more people are gunna take values issues into account do you think.\n",
      "\n",
      "[E2] Yes I think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "[P1] Final word with Victoria Kearney you've been on Sunday Night a debate <,> about what would Jesus do in the case of the electoral process.

      "[C1] Well it's not that bit it's um it's about three feet 'cos I only know feet <P1 yes>. About three feet high and um it's been doing so well my partner actually grew it from a seed we picked it up in a church garden <E1 mm> and our intention was to buy a house and plant it but we haven't got the house yet. So we've still got the fig and it's doing so well until recently. My um I think it's under stress God knows why <E1 mm> it's only on a balcony in a pot but it's getting a sort first of all I thought it was sunburn but the the leaves are getting oh um a pale ring and then after a while they crack <E1 mm>. And <,> and then they break off first of all I thought oh golly it's a bug or something eating it. But no it seems to be happening as they're growing they're perfectly fine and then intermittently they get this it's it's as if somebody has um um put some hydrogen peroxide on them or something and then.\n",

      "[Presenter 2: Jurate Sasnaitis, F] Good afternoon Lynne.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> It's like being at school. And we talk about a book which is just like every other book club and I really just started this because I wanted to be in a book club and <P2 laughs> nobody would ask me so I thought I'd start my own.\n",

      "[P2] Oh look it's so funny isn't it <P1 but> did you want to tell that story like how much Jurate hated this book and so let's do it for book club <P1 laughs>. And then Jurate changed her mind.\n",
      "[P1] And Lynne takes an opposite view <P2 mm> so we will explore all this in its fascinating complexity. Alright Jurate you give us the plot what happens in The Lovely Bones.\n",
      "[P2] Well The Lovely Bones basically is narrated by Susie Salmon like the fish <P1 as she says> who's. As she says yes I didn't make that up and she's a fourteen year old and within the first few lines of the book we discover that she was raped and murdered in nineteen-seventy-three. Now she is in a place called heaven which she later discovers is kind of a bit like limbo actually it's not quite heaven heaven it is for people or souls rather who still cling to life on earth so what um Susie does from heaven from her vantage point of heaven is to observe in the next eight years as the plot goes on what happens to her family her mother father very young much younger brother and young sister the policeman mainly involved in her case and of course her murderer. So we get to see how all these people cope with the aftermath of a really horrid violent tragic event in their lives and how they grow uh cuh each very individually and very differently cope with grief <P1 mhm>. And that's the bare bones.\n",
      "[P1] Yes as opposed to The Lovely Bones <P2 mm> now yes we should point out that you didn't like it when you first read it <P2 no> a couple of years ago.\n",
      "[P2] But I suspect it's for the same reasons you didn't like it this time.\n",
      "[P1] Which are.\n",
      "[P2] Well for me I thought it was the most offensively saccharine vision of heaven I had ever read <laughs> what do you reckon.\n",
      "[P1] Well you thought that because ih uh in Susie Salmon's heaven everybody determines their own heaven if you like.\n",
      "[P2] Yes and you have the people that you want to encounter or they want to encounter you in their heaven and ih it looks like um somewhere that you I suppose feel safe and <P1 yes> and happy and comfortable. So if you're young if you're a fourteen year old in Susie's case it's her local high school but there are no teachers you know there are plenty of dogs playing around she manages to conjure her um life her gar well her death guide I suppose you'd say who's an older woman <P1 guardian angel> she realises like a mother figure angel. Um she f gets a friend they have slightly different versions but you know come together in the same version I mean it made me feel a bit sick the first time I read it I thought this is wrong this is.\n",
      "[P1] Why why did you think that bit was so wrong.\n",
      "[P2] Well <P1 see that that didn't actually> <P1 inaudible> just felt American to me actually.\n",
      "[P1] Yes well it was it was <P2 terrible to> <P1 inaudible> a fourteen year old high school vision yes of heaven. But uh I suppose <,> that was a little twee for me but.\n",

      "[P1] He's also known <E1 sounds reasonable> for his ability to open cosposting {composting} toilets so he can tell you anything worm farm problems certainly helped us and although I'm still confused about dry ingredients we might talk about that as well but eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two fine sunny day today top temperatures on the coast of twenty-seven inland thirty degrees Bowral enjoying twenty-seven and Katoomba twenty-five degrees currently around town on the coast it's seventeen that's four below <,> r Richmond and Bankstown are fifteen degrees Penrith sixteen Katoomba thirteen and Gosford twelve. One of the jewels in the open garden scheme crown is opening today and this is just a garden to envy how would you like <,> to have <,> a beautiful sandstone cottage nestled underneath a waterfall with a little pond and then a creek that runs through with thousands of water dragons so tame they come up and just <,> kiss you. Would you like to live there.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] Jeanne Villani does and we'll find out the secret of her open garden and give you the address so that you can go along today and tomorrow to see Waterfall Cottage which is a part of the open garden scheme all this and more because it is Saturday.\n",
      "[P1] Eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two Suzanne's on the line in McMahon's Point and.\n",
      "[P1] How are you.\n",
      "[C1] I'm good thank you.\n",
      "[P1] You've got a big fat <C1 laughs> Morton Bay fig.\n",
      "[C1] Well it's not that bit it's um it's about three feet 'cos I only know feet <P1 yes>. About three feet high and um it's been doing so well my partner actually grew it from a seed we picked it up in a church garden <E1 mm> and our intention was to buy a house and plant it but we haven't got the house yet. So we've still got the fig and it's doing so well until recently. My um I think it's under stress God knows why <E1 mm> it's only on a balcony in a pot but it's getting a sort first of all I thought it was sunburn but the the leaves are getting oh um a pale ring and then after a while they crack <E1 mm>. And <,> and then they break off first of all I thought oh golly it's a bug or something eating it. But no it seems to be happening as they're growing they're perfectly fine and then intermittently they get this it's it's as if somebody has um um put some hydrogen peroxide on them or something and then.\n",
      "[P1] Is there plenty of drainage in the pot.\n",
      "[C1] Yes uhuh um plenty I'm just wondering well obviously it's gotta come out of the pot and be planted in <,> <P1 mm> a proper place but.\n",
      "[P1] You think it's a case of Free Willy it wants to just go into the <C1 mhm> into the open.\n",
      "[C1] It does 'cos it's meant.\n",
      "[P1] I don't know Angus is that the case.\n",
      "[E1] Well the symptoms you describe um it it sounds could it possibly be water stress. Do you think the plant could be drying out from time to time.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah well it could be maybe I'm not giving it enough.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah they uh I mean they are a a rainforest tree that that's used to fairly constant moisture and and mulch y'know plenty of leaf mulch uh froh in the natural sort of environment um.\n",
      "[C1] Should I feed it some more. Ih feed it <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well I don't I wouldn't be so concerned about the feeding uh I mean what what you're in really is a sort of a holding operation.\n",
      "[C1] Yes that was the idea.\n",
      "[E1] So I think uh if you encourage more growth uh the plant's going to become uh more and more pot bound <C1 uh>. Suh so I would be thinking about putting it into a uh a slightly larger container and just gradually moving it up a a container size every year.\n",
      "[C1] Which I we have been doing it's about <,> oh it would be about three and a half years old now <E1 mhm>. And uh God knows how we're going to get it out of this pot <E1 and C1 laugh>. Um I it reminds me of what happens to a gardenia when it hasn't got <E1 mm> when you need to give it Epsom salts.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[C1] That's that's the sort of thing that seems to be happening with it. W would it.\n",
      "[E1] So it's sort of a yellowing of the <,> the foliage gradually.\n",
      "[C1] Yes only in a certain area and then that uh pale part breaks.\n",
      "[E1] Right yeah yep is it in the older foliage that you're noticing that. Or the new growth.\n",
      "[C1] Wih uh no um <,> yes it is well it is in the older foliage but <E1 yeah> I notice that with the new growth <,> it's starting to happen too.\n",
      "[E1] Yes well it yeah cih t obviously the a lack of nutrients would tend to make it pale off a bit but uh <C1 mm> uh perhaps you could just give it the occasional liquid feed. Uh one of the sorta complete liquid feeds that are on the market you can water that over the foliage and it will sorta feed those leaves 'n' 'n' keep them healthy <C1 yes> and I think just uh repotting it uh every year as you've been doing giving it a l bit more space um that's the way to go and they're pretty tough plants too so.\n",
      "[C1] I'd hate to be be responsible for anything bad happening to it.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C1] So maybe I should find a park somewhere.\n",
      "[E1] Well that's that's yeah <C1 inaudible> they do need a lotta space <C1 and E1 laugh> a park is a good option so.\n",
      "[C1] Mm mm.\n",
      "[P1] Well good luck with Suzanne.\n",
      "[C1] Okay thank you very much Simon love your show.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for being on it.\n",
      "[C1] Thank you bye.\n",
      "[P1] The perplexing Morton Bay fig problem they are beautiful trees though how long do they take the ones that we see round town that are humungous.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] How long how old would they be roughly.\n",
      "[E1] Well you're looking at hundred <P1 hundred years> years plus those huge buttress roots and that kind of thing ih they're just uh extraordinary.\n",
      "[P1] And we've come to understand now that we should have lots of h h not hummus or tabouli but humus underneath the roots and uh those <E1 mm> uh the beautiful air breathing s almost <E1 aerial roots> aerial roots.\n",
      "[E1] That's what they are exactly they're they're sort of support roots but they do like very well aerated conditions so grow them in a pot is quite feasible but uh they do like that constant moisture th that is provided by the humus that you mentioned Simon.\n",
      "[P1] And what about the um you know the the not ikebana the the the <E1 bonsais> bonsai-ing them can you bonsai them.\n",
      "[E1] Ah yes they make <P1 can you> fabulous bonsais.\n",
      "[P1] Maybe that would be Suzanne's option is to bonsai it.\n",
      "[E1] Well I c could be s recommended that's for sure.\n",
      "[P1] McMahon's Point she's right near North Sydney library she could wander up there and uh have a get a bonsai book out 'n' have her <,> portable <,> Morton Bay fig.\n",
      "[E1] I love it. Good bonsai with a bit of suiseki around the base.\n",
      "[P1] And a touch of wasabi bit of soya sauce <E1 laughs> tastes beautiful.\n",
      "[P1] Ah Lisa's on the line in Cammeray you've got mutant gardenias from another planet Lisa.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[C2] They've grown back. Beautifully.\n",
      "[P1] Good on you.\n",
      "[C2] But some of the leaves are enormous they're like sixteen centimetres long.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C2] Um but then others are normal size <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Sixteen centimetres.\n",
      "[C2] Sixteen <laughs> it's true I had a witness yesterday we measured it just to make sure I wasn't going completely mad um but yes <laughs> I don't know why.\n",
      "[P1] Is it growing a little sort of like whip spike out of the centre and feet from the side.\n",
      "[C2] <C2 and E1 laugh> No no triffid um <laughs> attributes or anything it is just the the I mean the leaves I mean it's been attacked by a by a caterpillar as well which I've managed to pick off most of those and I've got those under control but the <E2 mm> new leaf growth is just amazing it's glossy there's nothing wrong with it it uh <E1 mm> I mean it's just sprouting everywhere but some of the leaves are just huge.\n",
      "[P1] Is that normal <E1 yeah> for a gardenia Angus.\n",
      "[E1] Well I wouldn't say normal it uh but it plants will respond to to environmental conditions so it sounds like it's been on a very good paddock <P1 laughs>. If I could say that you've been uh obviously feeding it uh quite well by the sound of things.\n",
      "[C2] Well <laughs> look let me put it this way uh my green thumb is sort of uh more like a green fingertip <E1 right> I'm not exactly um y'know terrific <laughs> in the garden I'm like I put in an effort <E1 yeah> but I I just gave uh look I did um to resurrect them a little bit I put some Seasol on them to <E1 mhm> to try and get ev y'know remuh mulch the soil that sort of thing <E1 yep> get them back on track and then a slow r release fertiliser buh buh but that was about it.\n",
      "[E1] Well that's uh that's the idea though with those slow release fertilisers they're <C2 yeah> they the nutrients are always there for the plant and it's uh <,> yeah it's literally on a very good paddock uh but also light conditions can play a part as well um leaves will will respond to the environment and if there's a lower light level they can enlarge and and become a a darker green because there's more chlorophyll to catch the available light <C2 right> that sort of thing. So is it in a shadier usually.\n",
      "[C2] Well actually I uh I h I have to really keep the water up to them because they it gets sun most of the time <E1 mhm> but then by afternoon um we've got a sort of a m a mirella um sorta planted not far from it. I think it shadows the plant significantly in the afternoon I don't know if <E1 mm> if that makes a difference I mean like.\n",
      "[E1] Well it will.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah I would suggest uh s the leaves are just uh trying to catch as much light as possible <,> um so I yeah I don't think it's anything to worry about sounds to me like uh.\n",
      "[P1]It's saying thank you.\n",
      "[E1] It's saying thank you.\n",
      "[C2] I'm just <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Might need to get it a personal trainer and wear off a bit <C2 laughs> of that weight but part from that.\n",
      "[C2] I just think the flowers are gunna be amazing <laughs> when they cover my home.\n",
      "[E1] Yes yes we'd like to uh uh perhaps you could send some in for us.\n",
      "[P1] They'll be umbrella sized <C2 and P1 laugh>.\n",
      "[C2] I I'll remember that thanks very much.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for that Lisa <C2 okay>. Enjoy your weekend.\n",
      "[C2] You too bye-bye.\n",
      "[P1] Sixteen past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden guess what Angus <,> I have an orchid question for you next.\n",
      "[P1] Seventeen past nine and before we find out the orchid question Sally's on a mobile in Nowra. Hello Sally.\n",
      "[P1] How are you.\n",
      "[C3] I'm good thank you <P1 you> just travelling along.\n",
      "[P1] Heading south for a holiday.\n",
      "[C3] Yes <P1 y> yes having a lovely time.\n",
      "[P1] Very nice now you've got elephant ears that are suffering.\n",
      "[C3] Yes look I I seem to manage to get them to grow really really well outside Sydney um and I know that they're meant they like sort of dark moist areas but I was hoping to be able to get a better result um I'm planning on y'know getting them to try and grow them in Sydney and I was just wondering for a bit of advice.\n",
      "[E1] Elephant ears we're <C3 yeah> talking about a a tropical uf sub-tropical sort of plant there and uh what what they need is is warm as possible conditions. So yes they grow very well on place like thr the tropical islands of the pacific and so on so it's about understanding their environment I guess 'n' and giving them what they need. So yeah d deep rich sort of soil uh but a protected position near a uh a brick wall something like that where they can absorb a bit of extra heat in winter uh that'll that'll keep them going quite nicely.\n",
      "[C3] Okay I'll I'll give it a go if not I suppose a tropical island's in <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] You might just have to move to Fiji {foreign string}.\n",
      "[C3] <laughs> That'd be fantastic thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] Alright that's Angus's advice live in Fiji.\n",
      "[E1] Well Western Samoa would be my choice.\n",
      "[P1] Oh would it <E1 laughs>. Oh {foreign string} there we go that's completely different let's go off to that orchid question now and Danny's on the line in Baulkham Hills how are you Danny.\n",
      "[P1] It's an orchid seed pod you need help with.\n",
      "[C4] Yeah I've got a well I've got quite a few Cymbidium madidums.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm.\n",
      "[C4] And I've got with uh several seed pods on it and I was just wondering when they ripen so that I can collect them and then get them uh see if they can I can get them growing.\n",
      "[E1] Right well they actually change colour as they mature so start off green and they actually sit on the plant for quite a few months while they mature but gradually they will will change to a brownish colour and eventually they'll split open but they're a bit tricky orchid uh growing orchids from seed because they have very minute microscopic seeds that uh unlike most plants theh there's very little food source in the seed and uh normally uh most orchids germinate uh in conjunction with a fungus uh that uh is a a beneficial fungus that that really sorta creates an artificial root system for the orchid while it's getting established so what uh m or professional growers do is is grow them in a sterile nutrient uh environment. So <C2 nutrient> we call it tissue culture.\n",
      "[C4] Yeah a nutrie uh a nutrient agar. Yep.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C4] I understand how they're grown it's it's just when to uh pick them and put them into the paper bags <E1 yep> so like I can um <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well normally what uh they do if if you're going to get them tissue cultured is is they harvest them a little bit before they're mature while theh they're still um green but fully uh fully formed so do you have uh have you got a contact in the orchid game that's going to say.\n",
      "[C4] Oh no I was going to develop that but um <,> ih I was just wondering what if you can give me a guide on what month like uh.\n",
      "[E1] Yep. Uh well they're d it generally takes quite a few months for them to mature so probably about four months or so after they form I'm just uh I'm not expert in this area but <C4 yeah okay> it's around about that sort of time so you'll see the pod fully uh swollen uh uh uh when it stops sort of growing in size that's generally an indication that seeds are mature and then as they change colour that they're about to split open and uh. You can try and germinate them uh actually on some peat moss or something like that uh thah obviously that's how they grow in the in the wild uh by just normal germination. Um but but yeah that's uh only.\n",
      "[C4] So the nutrient uh agar's a a far more productive way of doing it.\n",
      "[E1] Well it is you just get a much higher percentage and <C4 mm> and uh better success rate. Mhm.\n",
      "[C4] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] Good luck with it Danny.\n",
      "[C4] Thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for phoning in the other orchids that I remember growing up with <E1 mm> and they used to be just on the rocks there are the rock orchids which is what Trevor in Carlingford would like to ask about am I right Trevor.\n",
      "[P1] So you've got them or you'd like them.\n",
      "[C5] Well I've got access to some <P1 mm> I want to grow a whole lot more <E1 mm>. A lot lot more <E1 mhm>. In which case I'd like to grow them from seed.\n",
      "[E1] Yep yep.\n",
      "[C5] I want to know what the seed looks like where it is and how do I propagate it.\n",
      "[E1] For <P1 good questions> sure the Sydney rock orchid Dendrobium speciosum.\n",
      "[C5] That's me animal.\n",
      "[E1] Yes they're uh they're actually a lithophyte meaning they they.\n",
      "[P1] No need to be rude.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> They grow in rocks and uh look they're a spring flowering plant and then the pods form on the uh spent flower so again it it takes several months for those pods to mature so you're actually coming into sort of summer autumn when they're maturing. So it's a matter of finding a plant that that has set some seed and again uh the the advice is they're they're very uh the seed is dust-like in character so <,> commercially they're they're propagated in tissue culture and on that nutrient agar we were just mentioning and uh ih that's one way of doing it uh the other way I suppose would just be to if you've got an appropriate sort of environment um if you've haven't got any natural rocks in the backyard you could you could bring in some large rocks. Uh bearing in mind that uh we don't wanna be plundering the bush for our uh our rock features. But uh if you can locate some some large sized rocks um I guess how they grow naturally is the those dust-like seeds are distributed on the rocks 'n' and uh protected usually in a very protected environment shade from the trees and reasonably constant sort of moisture.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah I would someone told me to grow moss <E1 yep>. On the rock and then put the seed on the moss and I just <E1 mm> <,> I've grown dehn well I've had Dendrobiums growing for years and I've never gr seen anything that w could recognise as a seed that was all.\n",
      "[E1] Yes yeah well that's uh probably 'cos they're so microscopic you you actually they're they're like specks of dust so you really uh if you get one of the seed pods and uh split it open you'll find it contains tens of thousands of of individual seeds so it's it's really a matter of catching the pod uh as it's ripening and um y you can actually put it into a paper bag and and you collect all that seed.\n",
      "[P1] In the paper bag and then <E1 well yes> what you sprinkle the paper bag over the moss or.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah well what uh what you could do is get a seed tray put some uh sphagnum moss in that and then uh put the seed much as like is done with ferns spores <P1 mhm> where uh yeah you get a seed tray and then put a sheet of glass over the top to to uh keep the humih humidity up while the seeds are germinating. And um yeah that that will give you generally a a higher success rate.\n",
      "[C5] Well that sounds excellent thank you very much and just as a little aside.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C5] <inaudible> tree that I got from you at the open day at the tip is now two metres tall.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C5] And I've just uh repotted thirty cuttings I took off it last year and they're all doing well and I thank you very much.\n",
      "[E1] Terrific.\n",
      "[P1] Wow thirty-one trees from thirty threes from one.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah good value isn't it.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[C5] <inaudible> <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] This is what we like to hear Trevor.\n",
      "[P1] That's great Trevor.\n",
      "[C5] See you later.\n",
      "[P1] Have a great day.\n",
      "[E1] Cheers.\n",
      "[P1] Twenty-five past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney.\n",
      "[P1] Ah this is seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and very shortly we're also going to find out about Waterfall Cottage Jeanne Villani has been tending this and it's an amazing garden many areas of uh ur set around a creek the waterfall plunges into this beautiful pool and the house and the creek goes down through the property and it's part of the open garden scheme I think for four or five dollars or uh y'know you get to wander around the garden take a picnic 'cos it's enough to do that and also uh see all the water dragons we'll meet Jeanne Villani and give you the address in the next half hour twenty-six minutes past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney a fine sunny day top temperatures on the coast of twenty-seven degrees thirty degrees inland and the outlook for tomorrow fine and sunny with some westerly winds starting ahead of a change and it'll be raining on Monday and Tuesday. Gillian's been waiting very patiently at Wyong Creek how are you Gillian.\n",
      "[P1] Very well you wanna propagate a melaleuca.\n",
      "[C6] Yeah um I've got a question for Angus <E1 mm> um I've tried propagating from my Melaleuca viridiflora a couple of times and um all I seem to get are some dead sticks <E1 right>. And I was hoping Angus might be able to give me a few pointers as to when is the best time to do it.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C6] Um <,> the other thing is that the trees I'm propagating from they're not fully matured trees <E1 mhm>. I don't know if that's got something to do with it or not y'know.\n",
      "[E1] Oh no that would help if anything uh so have you tried propagating by seed.\n",
      "[C6] No.\n",
      "[E1] Because <C6 I haven't> that's a I think probably the easier option.\n",
      "[C6] The reason I haven't done that is because I've been told <,> I don't know if it's true that if I propagate from seed they will revert back to the cream coloured flower not the red flower.\n",
      "[E1] Okay yep yep sure that <C6 and I want I really wanted the red> is a possibility.\n",
      "[C6] I really wanted the red flower.\n",
      "[E1] Yep yep <C6 mm> okay yes alright yeah cuttings are definitely an option. And what I'd be looking at is is taking cuttings uh at what's called a semi-hardwood stage which is uh ab around about now in fact.\n",
      "[C6] Mhm.\n",
      "[E1] So what you're looking for uh are the tips of the branches where the leaves have have started to or well have fully expanded um but the s the stem hasn't gone perhaps as woody as as um <C6 oh right> as it will.\n",
      "[C6] Yep mhm.\n",
      "[E1] <coughs> So what uh really ab over the next couple of months is is a good time to be trying uh and I'd be looking at a cutting say about ten to fifteen centimetres long <C6 right>. And removing the bottom uh few leaves <C6 mhm> and then uh I'd be trying one of the uh the rooting hormones <C6 yep mhm> that you can get which are um you dip the end of the cutting in a {break} and uh and then I guess ah just just putting into a a m a relatively sheltered environment if <C6 yeah> if you don't have a propagation house.\n",
      "[C6] No I don't no.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah yeah um but I find a a sheltered sort of uh deck or something like <C6 yeah> that where it's not getting blasting hot sun or wind and that sort of thing <C6 mm> will keep it c uh keep it pretty happy <C6 mhm>. And uh a good well drained buh you can get specialist propagation mixes based <C6 right> on coarse sand or perlite that sort of thing.\n",
      "[C6] And they're alright for natives.\n",
      "[E1] They're great f yes <C6 yep> perfect for uh for natives.\n",
      "[C6] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] And uh yeah that's I think uh will maximise your chances of success.\n",
      "[C6] Alright well thanks for that advice Angus.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C6] I'll give it a go.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[E1] And it it is worth trying from seed though even though you're not <C6 yeah> guaranteed.\n",
      "[C6] Yeah that's true yeah yeah it's worth it. I might get <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Uh <,> yes if the plants are growing in isolation uh if you've only got the red flowered form uh and they're pollinating each other then uh there's a very good chance the seed will come true to type.\n",
      "[C6] Yep okay yeah alright.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Gillian.\n",
      "[C6] Thanks a lot okay bye.\n",
      "[P1] There we go Gillian and her melaleucas at twenty-nine minutes past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney couple of gardening events from Simone's What's On include the Luddenham Show which is on today and tomorrow it's like the old fashioned show y'know the <E1 mm> produce show bit like Picton Saint Ives those sort of shows. Luddenham Show's today and tomorrow uh at uh corner of Park Road and Campbell Street in Luddenham and also the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show now Angus has been telling me about the Blue Mountains Dahlia Championship and let me tell you that is <,> a tense event it really is. Um.\n",
      "[E1] Look there's there's nothing like a cactus dahlia to to really get you.\n",
      "[P1] Ah mate.\n",
      "[E1] Get you going.\n",
      "[P1] And and the amount of work they go through do they still drug test at the uh Dahlia cuh Championship.\n",
      "[E1] They do <P1 yeah> yes yes steroids are a common <P1 no steroids> issue these days.\n",
      "[P1] Ih l also be vegetables pot plants floral uh arrangements and all sorts of things that's at the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show it's the seventy-eighth one and I think it's children free three bucks to get in ten till three-thirty uh also another event on today is the Cattai National Park Discovery Walk aln {along} the Hawkesbury River and along the clifftop Cattai visitors centre and tomorrow the Cumberland State Forest which is a fantastic little oasis in the <E1 it is> heart of the hills <,> Cumberland State Forest Castle Hill Road West Pennant Hills they're doing a bush tucker walk where the rangers will take you through the bush you'll get to identify edible food and then you'll have a tasting as well I think adults are about three bucks children two bucks but you do need to book and the phone number for that nine-eight-seven-one-double-three-double-seven nine-eight-seven-one-double-three-double-seven and of course our open garden scheme garden which we'll talk about in the next half hour but with a fine day ahead of us let's find out what's happening in news headlines and good morning to John Hall.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for that John and of course after the news at ten the Weekend Woodies resume their do it yourself home renovation and has Les managed to fix the horrible piece of mutilated timber that I gave him last week after I tried to make a shelf we'll find out about that tool of the week and a boofhead as well so that's stay with the weekend show.\n",
      "[P1] Right now Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and Colleen's on the line in The Entrance how are you Colleen.\n",
      "[P1] Very well but your agapanthus aren't.\n",
      "[C7] No very sick <E1 oh> very sick <P1 mm>. Yes they've got a white powder sort of stuff all over them and the leaves turn crinkly and yellow and die <P1 mhm> and it all goes to sorta jelly.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[C7] Mm.\n",
      "[E1] Right it sounds they're uh one of the world's toughest um <P1 yes> <C7 yes exactly> plants the agapanthus. What sort of conditions is it uh growing in.\n",
      "[C7] Well they've been there for years doing fine um <,> they're ou um plenty of light 'n' um just I don't know up the backyard in the garden.\n",
      "[E1] Yep yep so they're not uh yes I mildew <C7 mm> ih ih so you can rub th off this white <C7 yes you can> substance.\n",
      "[C7] And it goes right down into the to the uh centre of the plant.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm.\n",
      "[C7] Mm.\n",
      "[E1] Mkay <C7 inaudible> so it's not a insect or anything like that.\n",
      "[C7] No no no no.\n",
      "[E1] It s it sounds like a fungus yeah. Wuh yeah I've don't I've never struck agapanthus getting a powdery mildew or downy mildew but uh <C7 inaudible> I I guess it's it's uh it may be possible uh I guess fungicide would be uh indicated if if it is a fungus.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Um so.\n",
      "[C7] <inaudible> is it.\n",
      "[E1] I guess yeah without seeing it I I c I'd be inclined to recommend that you take a sample along to to your local garden centre 'n'.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah I I did think that yes.\n",
      "[E1] And get them to have a look at it <C7 mm> and um ih if they've got a good horticulturalist there they'll be able tell you whether it's fungal and and um recommend a a suitable fungicide. Uh if it is powdery mildew something like one of the sulfur based fungicides would would be uh indicated <C7 mm>. But uh I'd I.\n",
      "[P1] And also with the local ones they'd know what was happening in the area too wouldn't they.\n",
      "[E1] Yes yeah but it's.\n",
      "[C7] Yes and I've got a good one at over at Ourimbah a big t <E1 mm> All Seasons nursery over there I think I'll take one s plants over there might be me b best shot.\n",
      "[E1] Would be a good idea I think <C7 mm> to get a a a visual ala <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] And they don't mind if you walk in <E1 examination> and say can I h can I have the orh the y'know the horticulturalists they sort of.\n",
      "[E1] I'm sure they'd be.\n",
      "[P1] They'd be happy to do that.\n",
      "[C7] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Amenable but uh.\n",
      "[P1] In the yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C7] <inaudible>. It's worth a try because I've a loh I've got a lot of agapanthus.\n",
      "[E1] Yes it's unusual to to um hear of them having problems like that are they uh have they been divided up.\n",
      "[C7] No not recently no <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] 'Cos that can sometimes be a an issue with clumping plants like that as they get older uh the the clumps tend to sort of ih.\n",
      "[C7] W what's happened is some of the seeds have come off 'n' and um y'know grown again and even the younger plants have got it.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm mhm.\n",
      "[C7] As well as the older ones mm.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah but if the clump is very sort of tight uh sometimes dividing in them up can reinvigorate them 'n' and uh so if you dig up an old clump and and just uh uh split it gih give it a bit more sort of room to move <C7 yeah> uh it starts to grow vigorously again and uh with something like agapanthus I would think it would would would be able to grow through a problem like that <C7 yeah>. So that I would suggest be another strategy you could employ.\n",
      "[C7] Okay then well uh <E1 just> try all those and see what happens.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Colleen.\n",
      "[C7] Okay then good thanks very much.\n",
      "[P1] Good luck <E1 inaudible> twenty-four minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney.\n",
      "[P1] Two incidents causing problems today uh are at the moment there is an accident involving a car and a truck at Lane Cove West that's on Epping Road at Mowbray Road one of three westbound lanes are closed with moderate delays there and also Lidcombe Parramatta Road between Hill Road and Birnie Avenue. One of two eastbound lanes closed uh not as sh many delays there but eastbound traffic affected by that one twenty-three minutes away from ten.\n",
      "[P1] We've just had somebody ring in to say that uh it could be mealy bug on the agapanthus.\n",
      "[E1] Wh mealy uh I mean I did did uh ask Colleen about insects uh mealy bug can actually look like uh a fungus uh because it it has that sorta white uh cottony appearance. So that's why I think it'd be good idea to get a a second opinion at a g uh someone who can look at <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Hop along to the horticulturalist at the garden centre.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah yes if it is mealy bug then uh obviously it will need an entirely different treatment to a uh fungicide. It'll need an insecticide uh or you can wipe wipe them off and uh go down that road uh but uh it's it's a very nasty problem the mealy bug one and I'd be seeking help.\n",
      "[P1] Very shortly Jeanne Villani to talk about her open garden but first of all on the line is uh Lynne in Engadine how are you Lynne.\n",
      "[P1] Ah Lynne's playing the piano. Hang on <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah no that's very good Lynne <laughs>. Isn't that nice.\n",
      "[E1] Is that Rachmaninoff.\n",
      "[P1] Ah it's rack something off but there we go at twenty-two minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Bernie's on the line in Crow's Nest Bernie can you play the piano for us as well.\n",
      "[P1] Oh can he.\n",
      "[C8] Yeah <P1 and C8 laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] It's alright honestly <C8 yeah>. You wanna r move a satin ash.\n",
      "[C8] Yeah a Windsor satin ash <P1 right> <E1 mhm> Syzygium dansiei.\n",
      "[P1] Mhm.\n",
      "[C8] Just uh it's about one and a half metres high.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C8] Um it's been planted for about eighteen months just wanting to know if it's okay to to move it.\n",
      "[E1] Well they can be a bit tricky. Uh wuh uh I mean any evergreen plant that that is getting to that sort of size but look uh yes Syzygiums or lilly pillies are one of the more amenable plants to <,> to being pruned and then uh regrowing and and I think that's the key to transplanting uh evergreen plants when they uh the the biggest problem with them is water stress so if they've got a lot of uh leafy growth as lilly pillies tend to do then it creates a lot of water stress on the plant if you damage the root system when you move it. So what I would suggest is if you have no option but to move it is to to trim it back by about a third <C8 right> and uh obviously take as big a root ball as possible but but uh giving it maximum protection when it's uh been moved. There are some commercial products that that you can spray onto the leaves to to limit the water loss um and uh really waiting until the weather cools down as well and the plant goes into a sort of a a uh semi-dormancy <C8 right>. Uh all those things will will maximise your chances of success <C8 yep> and it it should be possible a metre and a half it it's getting to the limit of uh where it's a a feasible idea but uh I think it's definitely not impossible.\n",
      "[C8] Yep yep.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Righto.\n",
      "[C8] Alright thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Bernie.\n",
      "[C8] Righto.\n",
      "[P1] Let's see if Lynne's still playing the piano.\n",
      "[P1] That's beautiful isn't it.\n",
      "[E1] It is.\n",
      "[P1] Who would think Saturday morning's the best time just to sit listen to the radio <,> play a little bit of piano.\n",
      "[E1] Perhaps she's <P1 she's good>. Perhaps she's playing it to her um to her plant.\n",
      "[P1] Well she's got a cycad that's giving birth so maybe she's just playing the cycad soothing music in the nursery.\n",
      "[E1] Indeed.\n",
      "[P1] Good on you Lynne.\n",
      "[E1] Perhaps it's still in the maternity ward.\n",
      "[P1] Uh that could well be the question uh uh William's on the line in Artarmon hello William.\n",
      "[P1] Very well.\n",
      "[C9] The shot. My question relates to mwah to tomatoes and rhubarb.\n",
      "[P1] Right.\n",
      "[C9] Last year we had a terrific crop of rhuba of uh tomatoes <P1 and E1 yes>. And uh this year some wild tomato bushes have come up in the compost as a result of the compost <E1 mhm>. In the interim we planted nine um bushes of rhubarb <P1 oh beautiful>. We had two uh meals off them <P1 mm>. And now six of them have died is there any uh opposition to growing op uh rhubarb near tomatoes.\n",
      "[P1] Will tomatoes pick on rhubarb <C9 mm>.\n",
      "[E1] Oh I wouldn't have thought so the the sort of issues uh you're looking at with uh vegetables are uh it's crop rotation plants of the same family do tend to get similar diseases so y'know tomatoes and capsicums things like that they're <C9 yeah> very closely related.\n",
      "[C9] I see mm.\n",
      "[E1] But uh tomatoes and rhubarb are that's they're a long way apart botanically so I wouldn't think there would be any link between.\n",
      "[C9] Want to give the game away if I can't grow rhubarb.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Well it's a c could be a number of of factors. Ih uh.\n",
      "[P1] I know that from the provedores the fruit and veg guy the two things that have been causing problems this year have been rhubarb and tomatoes for the uh <C9 yep> commercial growers.\n",
      "[C9] Go on go on.\n",
      "[P1] So the wet weather the heat the wet weather the heat <E1 mm> have caused problems for particularly roma and those sort of <C9 yeah> tomatoes <C9 yeah>. And uh rhubarb's been tricky as well.\n",
      "[C9] Ours apollo tomatoes and they've been a terrific crop but we just had to change them to another bed this year.\n",
      "[P1] Right.\n",
      "[E1] Yes yeah.\n",
      "[C9] <inaudible> mm.\n",
      "[E1] Yes you've done the the right things there but certainly the the sort of conditions that that Simon's describing uh we've had in Sydney as well and ih it it does tend to predispose plants to root rots.\n",
      "[C9] Uh would you suggest uh replanting rhubarb with new crop new.\n",
      "[E1] Yes but doing it in a different spot.\n",
      "[C9] In a different spot.\n",
      "[E1] Yes yeah.\n",
      "[C9] Okay <E1 so> right.\n",
      "[P1] Good on you William nothing like fresh rhubarb is there.\n",
      "[C9] Enjoy your program.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for being on it.\n",
      "[C9] Good on you mate.\n",
      "[P1] It is seventeen from ten a little musical interlude from Lynne.\n",
      "[P1] It's beautiful <E1 laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] No one's ever done that to me before rung up and played the piano to me.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Yes.\n",
      "[P1] I feel I feel pressured uh precious and treasured.\n",
      "[E1] What about her cycad. This must get.\n",
      "[P1] Well the cycad <E1 piano> very peaceful. Let's.\n",
      "[E1] Twenty-four hours a day by the.\n",
      "[P1] Open the playschool window and see who's got their open garden this weekend.\n",
      "[P1] Jeanne Villani you play the piano as well don't you.\n",
      "[P1] I know 'cos the uh the size of of Waterfall Cottage how big's the actual garden.\n",
      "[E2] Uh oh probably <,> three acres I would think of the eight acres the property. It it's hard to know because it sort of one blends into the other.\n",
      "[P1] And it's in Bayview you get a lot of the sort of the the protection and rainforest around there from this beautiful gully isn't it.\n",
      "[E2] Yes yes it's um sort of a bit cooler down here than it is in the outside world.\n",
      "[P1] The uh there's several different rooms we follow the gully down but you've got areas going off with a dovecot and palms and that sort of thing describe if I was to walk around the garden what would I see.\n",
      "[E2] Well at the moment you'd see a lot of purple plectranthus because um it's a <,> it's a it's a plant that's very hard to uh sorry very easy to uh take cuttings from and uh so I've got a lot of it and it looks absolutely wonderful there's just big purple drifts. The other thing that's uh looking particularly good at the moment is uh are the gingers and the bat plant's in flower.\n",
      "[P1] Oh the bat plants are spectacular.\n",
      "[E2] Yes. Yes and all the rainforest trees are now growing th that I planted to extend the rainflorist {rainforest} forest belt. Um to protect the house um. Should the fires come <P1 right>. Um <,> they're all growing now so uh yes they're all different sort of areas.\n",
      "[E1] You've retained a lot of the natural uh vegetation there too Jeanne <E2 yes> haven't you.\n",
      "[E2] Yes yes there's a lot of uh large rainforest trees and then it uh goes off into the bush and uh <,> plus the wildlife so uh.\n",
      "[P1] The wildlife you mean the water dragons.\n",
      "[E2] Well no uh <laughs> they're they're no trouble because they eat the slugs and snails they're wonderful but uh <,> once the drought was over the wallabies weren't so bad eating all the uh all the buds on plants but uh now there's a family of brush turkeys have moved in and they're uh relocating the mulch and uh <E1 laughs> and some of the plants too while the uh while they're about it.\n",
      "[E1] Have you got any tips on dealing with a uh malicious brush turkey <E2 laughs> Jeanne.\n",
      "[P1] Ooh basting in a slow oven for four hours isn't it.\n",
      "[E2] <laughs> They they look as though they'd be a bit tough.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Now also around there are lots of ponds and indeed is the waterfall running.\n",
      "[E2] Uh no it's stopped uh again because it hasn't rained since uh oh which was the day when we had all the heavy rain Wednesday I think <P1 right>. And it hasn't rained since then and it goes underground but um <,> uh further down the creek it's running but it actually over the edge of the waterfall ih it isn't running at the moment unfortunately.\n",
      "[P1] Now I believe also that somebody works very hard cuh making all sorts of beautiful comestibles and teas.\n",
      "[E2] Mm <laughs> yeah they're all ready all I've gotta do is uh cut up the cake and uh we're ready to go.\n",
      "[P1] And what is Jeanne's cake this weekend.\n",
      "[E2] Oh well it's lemon muffins and brownies and carrot cake.\n",
      "[P1] Oh yum.\n",
      "[E1] And have you got any lemon myrtle tea to go with it Jeanne.\n",
      "[E2] No lemon and ginger tea <P1 and E2 laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] Terrific or you need <E2 I guess I could go and> some of those um.\n",
      "[E2] I could go and pick some lemon myrtle leaves and uh.\n",
      "[P1] You've got a lemon myrtle bush there.\n",
      "[E2] Oh yes yeah.\n",
      "[P1] So people can have a look at that as well I always get the address wrong so give us to us again.\n",
      "[E2] Ninety.\n",
      "[P1] Yep.\n",
      "[E2] Cabbage Tree Road Bayview.\n",
      "[P1] Ninety Cabbage Tree Road Bayview which of course is on the northern beaches.\n",
      "[E2] Yes.\n",
      "[P1] Turn left at um <,> Avalon. Am I right.\n",
      "[E2] No no no no no.\n",
      "[P1] No.\n",
      "[E2] No <laughs> um if you're coming down Mona Vale Road you turn left before you get into Mona Vale.\n",
      "[P1] That's right.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Yes uh.\n",
      "[E2] No no don't go as far as Avalon <P1 if> unless you're coming from Palm Beach <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] That's right <laughs>. So turn left at Mona Vale and it's ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview today and tomorrow Jeanne.\n",
      "[E2] That's right yeah.\n",
      "[P1] And from oh in about twelve minutes time.\n",
      "[E2] Yes ten till four-thirty.\n",
      "[P1] We'll let you get into it and w how much are you charging for to go in.\n",
      "[E2] Uh five dollars fifty for adults and children are free.\n",
      "[P1] And uh bring in uh suh uh suh a blanket to sit on 'cos it's a beautiful big garden. Have a great weekend.\n",
      "[E2] Well there are lots of seats.\n",
      "[P1] Lots of seats.\n",
      "[E2] Yes <P1 inaudible> they don't have to sit on the ground.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Jeanne have a great weekend.\n",
      "[E2] Good thanks Simon.\n",
      "[P1] There we go Jeanne Villani there and the address is ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and a most impressive garden and uh you can see the lemon myrtle and maybe see the brush turkeys as well twelve minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney the Weekend Show Angus there taking your calls and if you'd like to ask a question for the Woodies they're along after ten o'clock as well.\n",
      "[P1] Now uh let's just <,> hear a little bit no it's not there anymore let's see whether uh Beth wants to take Lynne's place do you Beth.\n",
      "[P1] Playing piano or um.\n",
      "[C10] Definitely not no no.\n",
      "[P1] You've got a cycad question.\n",
      "[C10] I have a cycad question I hope it's the same question as <laughs> as the other lady's and it helps her out too. I had a magnificent old cycad <P1 mm> <E1 mm> that has been in my care for about fifteen years and um it appeared to go to cycad heaven. And it was it's in a pot <E1 mm> and I simply left it and um <,> when it's rained it's rained and uh it's probably been I thought dead but we'll say dormant for <E1 mm> at least twelve months <E1 right> <P1 mm>. And in the last month or so it's had um a number of little cycads appear all around the edge of it <E1 mhm>. A mass masses of them <E1 mhm>. My question is um it's in a pot there's not there's really not very much room around those edges <E1 mhm>. Are these <,> little ones are they independent plants and can I separate them or are they part of the assumed deceased cycad.\n",
      "[E1] Uh yes <laughs> yeah.\n",
      "[C10] Can I separate them can I do something 'cos they will not last in the pot the way they are.\n",
      "[E1] Yes you can they are uh little vegetative um buds that are sprouting at the base there sometimes called pups <C10 uhuh> <P1 pups> and uh yes yeah they c they will uh gradually develop a an independent or root system of their own <C10 mhm> which enables you to to split them off and pot them up.\n",
      "[C10] Right.\n",
      "[P1] So <E1 so> when do you know is the right time to do that Angus.\n",
      "[E1] Well it's uh I'd I'd wait for the sorta cooler weather but but also you'll see uh if you dig actually try 'n' uh uh lift one out whether it's it's got a bit of a a root system at the base.\n",
      "[C10] Right.\n",
      "[E1] So I'd be guided by the the plants themselves <C10 mhm> just uh there's a a lot of them you might just have a scratch around one 'n' 'n' see when it's uh starting to develop a r a reasonable little root system of its own.\n",
      "[P1] Okay well there certainly are a lot of them <E1 mhm>. <laughs> I've I thought it was my my personal backyard phoenix.\n",
      "[E1] Ah.\n",
      "[P1] <inaudible>. It sounds like it.\n",
      "[C10] Oh it's been it's been a nice surprise.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C10] I was pretty ashamed of myself letting it die <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Well there you haven't let it die. Obviously <C10 no> if you've um you've nurtured it um.\n",
      "[C10] <laughs> It's come back alright.\n",
      "[E1] Uh what sort of music have you been playing it just out of interest <all laugh> to get that sort of result.\n",
      "[C10] Uh it gets the regular sounds of dogs barking and chooks cackling.\n",
      "[P1] Oh <E1 right> yeah well maybe piano'll help <C10 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] I thought <C10 I'll give it a try> a bit of A C D C but it'd have to be.\n",
      "[P1] A C D C for the cycads <C10 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Bon Scott variety <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[C10] Can ih can I ask one other very quick question.\n",
      "[P1] Yep.\n",
      "[C10] At what point is it too late to try to transplant a potted citrus. Where do you give up and just go buy a new one.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Well <,> I think that this is true of all woody plants they they can get root-bound <C10 mm> and and that's the uh the biggest issue. So really I'd I'd be guided by the the appearance of the root system. When you take it outta the pot if you see a lotta roots curling around the bottom uh really to me to get a decent sort of citrus tree y you're going to have to perform drastic surgery to cut off all of those um sorta curled roots <C10 yep> and uh prune the top of the plant to to compensate for that <C10 mhm> uh you you can resuscitate them and uh I would say it's a kill or cure sort of <C10 right> situation <C10 okay> and if you kill it well <P1 mm you're gunna go get another> g that's the time to go and buy an other one but.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> But it.\n",
      "[C10] It's sad already so.\n",
      "[E1] They are very resilient uh plants though <C10 mm> citrus uh but if you do sort of go down that route of uh the drastic prune of the roots and the top uh watch out for suckers coming from the rootstock <C10 mhm> uh at the base of the plant it'll sometimes induce those and you've just gotta uh knock those off with <C10 inaudible> your fingers.\n",
      "[C10] Mhm.\n",
      "[E1] But it it would be worth a try I would say to r to resuscitate it <C10 okay> but um.\n",
      "[C10] Again leave it leave it until a bit later on in the year.\n",
      "[E1] Yes yeah I'd autumn really is <C10 mm> the perfect time.\n",
      "[C10] Okay terrific.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[C10] Got a few tasks to do thank you so much.\n",
      "[P1] Good on you <E1 alright> Beth bye-bye.\n",
      "[E1] Let's see what uh Lynne's playing nowadays.\n",
      "[P1] Ah you're not playing the piano anymore.\n",
      "[C11] <laughs> Oh Simon look I'm sorry <laughs> <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Don't be sorry it was it was a lovely interlude. You've <C11 inaudible> obviously practised that tune for a while.\n",
      "[C11] I know you're culturally appreciative so I thought that might've been nice little interlude sorry about that my bad manners.\n",
      "[P1] It was b <laughs> <C11 laughs> but I think we might have answered your cycad question.\n",
      "[C11] Well mine's just it's about thirty years old and it's huge about nearly a metre and a half high <P1 mm> and all of a sudden we've got a baby at the bottom of it.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm.\n",
      "[P1] A pup.\n",
      "[C11] Yes.\n",
      "[P1] That's what they're called.\n",
      "[C11] A pup.\n",
      "[P1] A pup.\n",
      "[C11] A pup of cycad.\n",
      "[P1] There we go.\n",
      "[C11] Okay so what what do I do.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah uh well I think just just wait to to the for the cooler weather and and you can actually just excise that from the plant <C11 uhuh>. Uh provided it's got a a few new little roots of its own <C11 right> and pot it up into a uh and put it in a protected sorta position and uh with a bit of luck it it will just uh grow into a it's own independent plant.\n",
      "[C11] Good.\n",
      "[P1] And the music <E1 inaudible> that Lynne should play to it you say A C D C.\n",
      "[E1] Well I've always had good success with with uh the Bon Scott A C D C type but obviously piano is is good too.\n",
      "[P1] Working a treat <all laugh>. Good on you Lynne.\n",
      "[E1] It's <C11 inaudible> underrated I think music and <P1 thanks for that> plants.\n",
      "[C11] <laughs> Bye.\n",
      "[P1] Six minutes away from ten which means it's uh less than uh ten minutes away from the Woodies and on the line we have Jack in Concord how are you Jack.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C12] They're the dwarf ones.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C12] And they've been here for about two years <E1 mm> and they've been going quite well <E1 mhm>. But in the last say two months I've lost three of them <E1 mhm>. They've just uh dried up uh or <E1 yep> or something's happened to them and they're just dying.\n",
      "[E1] Okay so you seeing anything on the tops that <,> insect damage or fungal growth anything like that.\n",
      "[C12] No there doesn't seem to be anything wrong they were <E1 yeah> going quite well <E1 right okay>. And then all of a sudden they just started to go brown <E1 yep>. Uh lost their uh green and they've just dried up.\n",
      "[E1] Mm mm or lost their gold in this case.\n",
      "[C12] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Uh but look there's a couple of possibilities I can think of. The golden diosma ih it actually belongs to the citrus family believe it or not um Rutaceae <C12 yeah> and uh they can be a little bit susceptible to to rootrots uh and the weather we've been having would would uh with the humidity and so on would uh perhaps predispose the plants to something like phytophthora or rhizoctania one of the fungal root rots <C12 mm> uh so you could try something like uh Anti Rot on the plants that are are remaining to boost their sort of immunity to root rots if that's what it is but what I would be doing is is pulling up the the dead ones <C12 yes> and having a a look at their root systems uh because the other thing that's starting to uh come into play at the moment is uh curl grub uh curl grubs the larvae of the uh African black beetles.\n",
      "[P1] A few people weeding go isn't that cute I've got a witchetty grub in my garden but it's not is it.\n",
      "[E1] No they're well usually they're they're uh curl grubs or something similar which are feeding on the root system. And uh that can uh damage the plant in itself and it can also provide an entry site for these rootrots so I'd be digging up the dead ones and and having a look at their root systems if you can find any of those curl grubs you'll uh might need to take preventative action to to save the other <P1 how do you get> fifteen <P1 fifteen> golden diosmas.\n",
      "[P1] How do you get rid of the uh curl grub.\n",
      "[E1] Well there are various chemical treatments you can use um I guess that's probably the there is uh also a uh a nematode beneficial nematode that is available <,> for home gardeners that you can water in it's a microscopic eelworm they're called but they they can actually get into the curl grub and and uh kill it uh uh in a a more natural sorta fashion.\n",
      "[C12] Yes well where they're growing uh like uh I had a natural garden along but <E1 mm> I dug those up and uh we had a lot of um oxalis growing <E1 yep>. Now I had to get rid of that <E1 mhm> so I sprayed it with um Roundup <E1 right> nuh and then I covered it with um ah <,> uh uh um.\n",
      "[E1] Mulch.\n",
      "[C12] Gra brah uh grass mat <E1 yep>. And then put pebbles on top <E1 mhm>. And uh but they've been going quite well up till uh and these three are all together.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C12] G y'know all the rest are good.\n",
      "[E1] Yep yep m well again that would tn tend to suggest something attacking the roots they couldn't have got a a whiff of the herbicide could they.\n",
      "[C12] Well I don't think so I I made <,> ev uh uh very sure about putting this Roundup on <E1 yeah> I rung up their information bureau and they said it wouldn't hurt the uh soil at all <E1 mm> uh that's what their <E1 yeah> uh reasoning was <E1 yeah>. So I just put the w I waited for a good few weeks <E1 mhm> and uh y'know before I planted them.\n",
      "[E1] Yes no should be okay yes I'd I'd be looking at the the curl grubs and the the root rot question.\n",
      "[P1] Alrightio.\n",
      "[C12] Yes I'll do that and find that out.\n",
      "[E1] Okay <P1 mm good> good luck Jack.\n",
      "[C12] Ah and there was one other thing.\n",
      "[P1] Ooh we're outta time Jack 'cos the news is breathing down on us I might <C12 inaudible> get you to hold the line and if Angus is feeling in a good mood he might chat to you during the news. Can you hold on.\n",
      "[C12] Okay yeah.\n",
      "[P1] There we go and also Wally in coh in Neutral Bay hold the line we'll uh get you to the news time I'm just wanting to let you know that the address for the open garden scheme today Cabbage Tree uh Waterfall Cottage is ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and uh that's right near Mona Vale on the northern beaches ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and Angus we'll see you in five weeks time I think on your home turf.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] I might be broadcasting from the studios of ninety-two-point-five in Erina so uh we'll see you up on the coast <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] On my own dung hill <P1 that's it> <inaudible> say.\n",
      "[P1] And uh luke look forward to using the compost toilet or something like that.\n",
      "[E1] Well I'll bring in some uh some worm uh droppings for you.\n",
      "[P1] What are the <E1 Simon> things we put in worm farms apart from garden kitchen waste I've put in torn up cardboard.\n",
      "[E1] Yes uh straw <P1 right> uh just sort of old old uh lawn clippings that have dried out <P1 beauty> that sort of thing will will open it out and get some oxygen in to to help the worms along.\n",
      "[P1] Oh that's what I need to do is to help the worms. The Weekend Woodies are up next speaking of worms and they'll be taking your calls on anything round the house that's causing problems and of course in Saturday Talkabout Tony Delroy is joined by Leo Compton and Jen Fleming to look back at the week on the wireless a fine day today top temperature on the coast of twenty-seven degrees thirty degrees inland but right now on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney it's news time ten o'clock.\n",

      "[P1] That's good how's your day.\n",
      "[C1] Ah good so far um yeah nice and sunny.\n",
      "[P1] Well it'll probably go downhill <E2 yes> <E1 laughs> <E2 inaudible> from the news let's let's start on that's right you want to paint floor tiles.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah um uh we've just renovated our house um and we haven't got to the bathroom yet but it's got like Mission Brown floor tiles on it and also the downstairs foyer.\n",
      "[P1] Can't have too much taupe in your life can you.\n",
      "[C1] Sorry.\n",
      "[P1] You can't have too much brown in your life.\n",
      "[C1] Oh no no not <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] And or beige for that matter.\n",
      "[P1] Beige is beautiful.\n",
      "[E2] Beige is a good colour.\n",
      "[P1] Speaking <inaudible> it's the colour of your shirt <E1 laughs>. So what you wanna paint them.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah yeah and I don't know if there's a product out there that I can actually <,> paint over the top of the tile.\n",
      "[E2] Have these got a glaze on them Julie.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah yeah a slight glaze.\n",
      "[E2] Uh <,> um probably not the best surface to paint on I mean if it's a r a rough porous tile <C1 ah> that probably would be fine <C1 right so>. Um but I'd I'd uh I yeah I don't think you could guarantee a surface on a on a glazed tile a painted surface on a glazed <E1 there there> tile.\n",
      "[E1] There certainly is an uh uh an epoxy paint which is d which is ds designed for the purpose. Um and but you may well find that they ask for some sort of a special preparation coat first a coat that would um etch that would etch the glaze otherwise the um.\n",
      "[E2] You need to get some sort of rough <P1 a key yeah a key> surface mm.\n",
      "[E1] A a key a key and.\n",
      "[E2] Look it th there is a etcher <E1 yep yes I'm> isn't there.\n",
      "[E1] I'm I'm almost sure that that the whole answer to the question is yes <,> that um that the first process will be to apply an etching coat first <C1 right> and then to apply the two pot um <E2 screamer> <coughs> epoxy uh floor finish.\n",
      "[C1] Right so you couldn't use that one that they're advertising now um you know to go over the tiles on the wall. As in um I won't say the.\n",
      "[E1] I I I would suspect that the that the wearing value of that would not be um suitable for floor use.\n",
      "[C1] Right okay then.\n",
      "[P1] Mm it's pretty high traffic area isn't it <E1 inaudible> especially the the the entry.\n",
      "[E1] A a bathroom a bathroom floor calls for a tremendous amount of work <C1 right> and and that's why the why it's always glazed <C1 ai> . And um I'd I think though that you'll find that if you go down that same path the the same manufacturer will be able to supply for you a two pot um epoxy paint that would be suitable for the floor.\n",
      "[E2] And two places to check if you go to a tile supplier and ask if <,> <C1 yep> if they know of such a product <E1 they'll say no> but also  a s they'll probably say no but then <E1 they'll say no> then go to a specialist paint store not <E1 oh for sure yeah> not just the hardware but someone <C1 right> that specialises in paints where are you Berkeley Vale are you.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah.\n",
      "[E2] Where's that.\n",
      "[C1] On the Central Coast.\n",
      "[P1] Central Coast.\n",
      "[E2] On the Central Coast.\n",
      "[E1] I used I used to have a block of land at <E2 did you> Berkeley Vale <E2 yeah> when I was a kid.\n",
      "[E2] Oh well I just don't know any specialist <C1 it's the best part of the Central Coast> paint stores around there.\n",
      "[C1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] I beg your pardon.\n",
      "[C1] We're central we're the best part of Central Coast.\n",
      "[E1] Yes <E2 yes> m midway between Wyong and The Entrance.\n",
      "[E2] No I <C1 that's right> let I knew it I was just that's that was my deliberate mistake but it.\n",
      "[E1] Uh uh it was a test oh I see it was a test.\n",
      "[P1] Ah that was a test.\n",
      "[E1] Julie we're being tested.\n",
      "[E2] There's a specialist paint stores that might have the product you want but you're looking for something to etch the glaze so that you you get a good key I think <E1 mm> that's the trick that's the key to it really.\n",
      "[E1] Yep <C1 okay> yep.\n",
      "[C1] Wonderful.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[C1] Okay thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] Good luck with it.\n",
      "[C1] Okay then.\n",
      "[P1] There we are c <C1 bye> doing the tiles on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales guess who's coming in after eleven o'clock for Saturday Talk About.\n",
      "[E2] Dunno.\n",
      "[E1] We dunno.\n",
      "[P1] You don't know.\n",
      "[E2] No he said to <E1 are we> guess.\n",
      "[E1] <inaudible> <E2 inaudible> <P1 inaudible> Tony Delroy.\n",
      "[P1] The you're exactly right so isn't that a I love it when Tony <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] But will he turn up.\n",
      "[P1] Well I dunno.\n",
      "[E2] I last time he was late.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah <laughs> he's always late isn't <E1 I> he.\n",
      "[E1] I listened to Tony's el delway {Delroy} until two A M this morning.\n",
      "[P1] And isn't that amazing that he uh uh working till two <,> and he will be back here at eleven o'clock to do Saturday Talk About.\n",
      "[E1] That's alright.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah I think that's okay.\n",
      "[E2] It's not that good it's just it's what still eight or so hours sleep isn't it.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah <E1 inaudible> but we have to pay him penalties because it's working with insufficient break <E2 inaudible>. It's very noble of him and we also have coming along Leon Compton from A B C Goulburn Murray and Jen Fleming producer of A B C Afternoons to look back at the week on the wireless in Saturday Talk About. Let's head off to sunny downtown the town that's got the corner of churches and l on the line we have Janelle how are you Janelle.\n",
      "[P1] Is it uh Hoskins Street four churches on one corner.\n",
      "[C2] Yes it's uh yes <P1 mm> yes yep that's it.\n",
      "[P1] But it's no help <E laughs> to your stained fridge is it.\n",
      "[C2] <laughs> No looks like there's some sorta cleanser been used on the front of the fridge and it's got this sorta rusted effect <P1 right> on the front and I'm just wanting to know whether I could actually use something else to get the rust off or paint over top.\n",
      "[E2] Ih is the rust actually ih zih biting into the um.\n",
      "[C2] No.\n",
      "[E2] Into the steel of of.\n",
      "[C2] No looks like it's only stained it.\n",
      "[E2] Oh really <E1 is this> the rust is coming from somewhere it's gotta be coming from the the the metal the <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Did somebody rest a tin on it or something.\n",
      "[C2] No no it was just uh there's some wrong sorta cleanser been used on the front of it. And it's just actually stained the front like you can actually see where the wash mark's been done with the <,> the cleanser on it <E2 mm> on the front.\n",
      "[E1] How old's the fridge.\n",
      "[C2] Uh f three or four years <E2 uh> <E1 ah>. It's not an old fridge it hasn't been outside or anything like that.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] I I <coughs> I think that that as this damage has occurred to it uh while there there are materials called appliance white and uh and things like that that you can buy from your ha local D I Y shop uh and it does a fair job <,> I would suggest that because the fridge is still quite young <C2 yep>. It may well be worth having it professionally sprayed <C2 yep yep>. Uh where they will bleach the marks out of it first and then <C2 right> they'll spray it.\n",
      "[E2] 'Cos you want it <E1 uh> the fridge to last for as long <E1 yeah that's right indeed> <C2 mm> as you can.\n",
      "[E1] S see that I I would suspect that that that the fridge will will probably last her um seven to fifteen years depending upon make or manufacture and uh it would only cost I would think a hundred-and-fifty dollars for someone to come home and get the fridge and take it away and spray it and bring it back.\n",
      "[E2] Or take the door it's the door is it.\n",
      "[C2] Yes it is.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah just take <E1 yeah well> the door off.\n",
      "[E1] Take the door off <C2 yep> yeah that's the idea.\n",
      "[E2] Um the the the products that that the appliance white products are usually for touching up little <E1 yeah they are> blemishes <E1 inaudible> rather than a uh than a whole surface <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Although I have been known to to spray the whole <E2 have you> laundry cupboard <C2 laughs>. It was totally unsatisfactory <E2 yeah> I got into trouble for it.\n",
      "[E2] Becoh that's quite expensive that stuff you f f you know that would've been quite costly it would've.\n",
      "[E1] Well I was trying to save having to buy a cupboard.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah <,> yeah.\n",
      "[E1] I didn't get away with it <laughs>.\n",
      "[E2] That's all we can think of <E1 no I>. So try that.\n",
      "[C2] At the moment I'm just covering it with children's drawings at the moment so.\n",
      "[E1] Uh that's a great way to go.\n",
      "[E2] It's a temporary measure.\n",
      "[P1] What's ih it's a really obvious brown thing is it.\n",
      "[C2] Yes it is.\n",
      "[P1] Mm wonder what you what caused that what sort of cleanser would've caused that.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah I'm not real sure but yeah just doesn't look very nice at all.\n",
      "[E1] An and and have you tried various bleaches to remove it.\n",
      "[C2] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Mm I thought they were <inaudible> gone down that path.\n",
      "[E2] Sounds like a respray of the door yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Yes I <C2 inaudible> it sounds like the like the structure of the of the paint has been affected in <C2 yes> some way.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] But maybe someone out there's got a bright idea.\n",
      "[C2] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[C2] Thanks a lot.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Janelle.\n",
      "[C2] Okay bye.\n",
      "[P1] There we go quarter past ten seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales y'know Temora's home to the during World War One was the largest R double A F elementary training school.\n",
      "[E2] Is that so.\n",
      "[P1] It is.\n",
      "[E2] Look I tell you Janelle wasn't too impressed with you that you knew the four churches there. <P1 no sure sure> she didn't seem to just wanted to move straight on <P1 yeah I've got my chur> to the fridge <P1 I've got my fridge> yes <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Still want to know about fridge door.\n",
      "[E2] That's right.\n",
      "[E1] N not y not you and your knowledge of the four churches <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Oh I think it's good to have it's a bit like Adelaide y'know every church every church corner has a <E2 oh it's true> pub opposite.\n",
      "[E2] It's lovely it's just Janelle wasn't really impressed that uh uh y'know maybe people of Temora are just used to it.\n",
      "[P1] Bob from Neutral Bay <E1 inaudible> however<,> has.\n",
      "[E2] Though what denomination are they I mean it'd be good if they were <,> Catholic <E1 either Presbyterian Catholic> Proddo a mosque and a synagogue.\n",
      "[P1] No no no they're all they're all.\n",
      "[E2] That'd be terrific and and very convenient <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> <inaudible> I reckon <E1 no no>. Bob from Neutral Bay said.\n",
      "[E1] Stop stop now.\n",
      "[P1] This is remember <E1 stop now> we had um uh Julie from Berkeley Vale <E1 yeah> <E2 yep>. With the uh with the.\n",
      "[E2] Oh the Central Coast.\n",
      "[P1] Central Coast.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Julie wanted to turn her brown floor tiles a different colour Bob from Neutral Bay said that he once painted his boat a nice blue with epoxy paint he did it <E2 yeah> <E1 yeah> about five years ago and then he accidentally wuh after painting it he <E1 yeah> walked on some brown floor tiles with his boots <E1 yeah> covered in blue paint <E1 a boofhead> and um uh the paint's been there ever since. So he reckons that <E1 oh yes> <E2 laughs> using that boofhead logic <E1 yes> it's hard wearing Julie from Berkeley Vale should use an epoxy paint.\n",
      "[E1] Tha that's that's why we we said it w we <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] Equals a two pot <E1 yeah> a two pot is a <E1 two pot> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] A two pot screamer is epoxy paint.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[E2] It's a hardener <P1 that's right> ih yeah one one part is the <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] A reference hardener.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] An and apply it with the boot of a shoe <,> boot sole of a boot.\n",
      "[P1] Well I think yes that's <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] There you go Julie give it do a practice bit somewhere.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah paint a boat and then do it that way.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Geoff\n",
      "[P1] How are you.\n",
      "[C3] Not too bad here Simon.\n",
      "[P1] You've got squeaky chipboard floors.\n",
      "[C3] Yes over the years you've answered quite a few questions on uh s squeaky uh timber floors but <E2 yeah> not so much on squeaky uh wood panel floors or chipboard floors. I've got an upstairs area with carpet uh over chipboard <E2 yeah> and just wondered what to do either now or even potentially in the future if I wanna take the carpet up and uh replace it with either more carpet or uh with timber floors.\n",
      "[E2] Just renail it. It's uh y'know um use the spiral nails uh normally chipboard floors are glued to the uh <E1 but some people don't> structure and some <E1 some people don't> people don't. And sometimes they're squeaking at the joins and sometimes uh in fact almost all the time where the board where the the board often uh a join is not straddling a piece of structure and it's not even required to because they're set up so that they can they can cope with that <E1 they join continuously> that little span so so um that causes the squeak but the best thing is to um go over it and renail it quite cluh I mean you'd put a nail every three-hundred mil <C3 inaudible>. Uh use a spiral fifty mil nail or even a sixty-five mil <C1 sixty-fives yep> spiral. And uh.\n",
      "[C3] <inaudible> screws if I screwed it.\n",
      "[E2] Oh fantastic.\n",
      "[E1] Oh yeah by all means yeah yeah.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah it's just a lot it's y'know <E1 blaze away> it'd be a lot a more time consuming but that would be better. Um uh but and then you can I suppose dump some talc along the joins y'know the actual where the boards wih the joints of the of the actual sheets. But um it's more likely to be with that sort of product squeaking because it's pulled itself off the joists <E1 I I> <inaudible> a little bit loose.\n",
      "[E1] I always glue glue that stuff down.\n",
      "[E2] Mm.\n",
      "[C3] Okay then thanks very much.\n",
      "[E2] It's too late now you can't glue it is it a first floor.\n",
      "[C3] It's <E2 is> the first floor.\n",
      "[E2] It's at the top so you can't get underneath it.\n",
      "[C3] No.\n",
      "[E2] No um no I think it y it's all you can do is renail it.\n",
      "[E1] Just renail it yep.\n",
      "[E2] But or either sc or screw that's even better but if you nail it use a spiral use something with a helix on it so it really pulls the board <E1 an and> down.\n",
      "[E1] And and ih if that squeak happens to be um in an u in a piece of unsustent uh uh unsupported floor. Well then you might uh when the floor's up uh c c can you at at the underside of the floor.\n",
      "[C3] Not at all.\n",
      "[E2] No.\n",
      "[E1] It's got a f ceiling in the way.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah <E1 there you go> lool look with with particle board it's usually that it's pulled up and it's sliding up and down on the on the fasteners yeah. Alright so that's all you all really all you can do and all you need to do.\n",
      "[E1] Uh 'cos quite often they're nailed with a with a gun.\n",
      "[C3] And if I replaced the upstairs carpet with timber I'd just go over the top of the uh the particle board with that.\n",
      "[E2] With timber how do you mean timber floorboards.\n",
      "[C3] Yeah yeah possibly timber floorboards.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah well you'd <,> uh few little little issues there one's ceiling height and the obvious the cutting the doors up and all that but you're nailing gotta find the joist to nail the boards to and you've gotta somehow cramp the boards and you can't grab the joist with a floor cramp because there's <E1 inaudible> particle board underneath <E1 yeah>. If you you use a kiln dried product that then w then will expand a little bit you'd probably get the boards tight enough but don't be surprised if once you've done it you you get little <,> cracks opening up.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah mooh <coughs> moving gap.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah you'll get little gaps between the floorboards. That's not an un <E1 ah> that's not <E1 that's not a bad thing> uh unattractive thing yeah. But use kiln dried material uh and leave 'n' 'n' s put it down when it's quite dry.\n",
      "[E1] All floorboards expand and contract.\n",
      "[C3] Thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Geoff.\n",
      "[E1] <inaudible> at least it won't squeak.\n",
      "[E2] That's right.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for that Geoff.\n",
      "[E2] Famous last words.\n",
      "[E1] But it won't but it won't.\n",
      "[E2] No no no.\n",
      "[P1] It is twenty past ten seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales the Weekend Woodies you've got your tool.\n",
      "[E1] I have.\n",
      "[P1] It's a not it's a very nice one <sound effect> it yeah yep oh okay you wanna do it now.\n",
      "[E1] No no any time.\n",
      "[P1] Well give us a teaser luh gih ih dih ih <sound effect>. Oh it's for tuning in the orchestra isn't it <E1 uh> <sound effect>. It's a triangle you've just joined the percussion group.\n",
      "[E1] Bong bong.\n",
      "[P1] It's medication <E1 laughs> time.\n",
      "[E2] Medication time <all laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] Let's head off to uh ah uh <E1 laughs> Terry in Harboard who wants to know whether he should wax. Terry are you there. Hello Terry.\n",
      "[P1] You wanna you wanna get a wax.\n",
      "[E2] Just the back or the <laughs>.\n",
      "[C4] <laughs> Yeah.\n",
      "[E2] Or the whole thing <laughs>.\n",
      "[C4] The whole thing the whole goal.\n",
      "[P1] Now it depends how hairy you are Terry.\n",
      "[C4] <laughs> Not very so won't be a big job.\n",
      "[P1] Alright now this is the old timber deck question.\n",
      "[C4] No not not an old one I've just built a timber deck.\n",
      "[P1] Oh no the old question but the new timber deck.\n",
      "[C4] New timber deck yeah <P1 yep>. And it's uh it's all external and uh I'm not really <,> all that uh keen on putting on a um um a varnish or something because of the <,> the work that is involved with keeping it up there um with brushing it all the time.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[E2] Mm.\n",
      "[C4] But possibly uh an oil finish or maybe a wax finish or something on the on the timber it's um it's iron bark on all the handrails and I've used white mahogany on the posts.\n",
      "[E1] That's lovely.\n",
      "[C4] So uh and.\n",
      "[P1] Sounds <E1 inaudible> like a beautiful deck.\n",
      "[E1] See that that this you've you've done something very wise you've chosen materials that are durability one <E2 mm> for a start <,> <C4 mm> and so the the the material is going to last. But uh and and you've also selected an oil finish to go over it and the oil finish will um <,> will will help to prevent the sun from drying out the surface fibres of the wood which is also a plus um and by putting an oil over it <,> you do you do need to come back to it every two or three years and hit it again <C4 mm>. But um but the oil is certainly the most refurbishable.\n",
      "[P1] And when you're doing it every two or three years do you have to l sand and then oil or is it just a matter of slapping it on and walking away.\n",
      "[E1] Depends on how <P1 <inaudible> clean it up> on on on how early you get it. You you just keep your eyes on it and the moment it starts to show any <P1 laughs> d deterioration <laughs> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Gee what are you doing Terry <E1 inaudible> minding the deck <laughs> yeah> ah still watching that deck <E2 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] I'm watching the deck.\n",
      "[E2] Don't you think <E1 inaudible> you should go out or go the toilet.\n",
      "[P1] No I'm watching the deck.\n",
      "[E1] Look ih uh if if you do know what I mean <,> uh just keep your eyes on it and if it starts to look a bit sad whip another coat into it straight away now you'll find that in so doing you'll be able to simply uh recoat or overcoat it every couple of years. Uh from time to time it will start to fade a bit and uh and if it does just give it a a paint over with a with a wood cleaning product. And that's a that's a paint on hose off operation and then come back 'n' give it another another coat of oil.\n",
      "[C4] Okay.\n",
      "[E2] What are the floorboards.\n",
      "[C4] They're no uh actually terracotta tiles. The whole the the the deck.\n",
      "[E2] Oh I see so it's uh like like a fibre cement.\n",
      "[C4] <inaudible> balustrading and the posts and of course all the fob subdeck frame is all timber.\n",
      "[E2] Yep and you've got fibre cement and you've sealed that <C4 inaudible> so that you don't get water getting under the structure underneath.\n",
      "[C4] <inaudible> polyurethane uh membrane and then come up from there. But what I was wondering about is the in the linseed oil or maybe m some more like.\n",
      "[E2] No linseed.\n",
      "[E1] No no linseed oil it go goes sticky. It's a pain the neck.\n",
      "[E2] Also.\n",
      "[E1] It won't dry.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah helps mould to grow all sorts of things like that.\n",
      "[C4] So you're better off buh getting something like a.\n",
      "[E1] Proprietary line and you go for the highest U V rating you can. The higher the U V rating <,> the less often you have to paint it.\n",
      "[C4] Okay then.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah and there are proh there are products especially for there are d things <E1 yeah> there's a product called decking oil and a couple of. No no but it's the company call it. A lotta the companies <E1 laughs> have it they call it decking oil.\n",
      "[P1] Right it's a line.\n",
      "[E2] It's a that's a <inaudible> <E1 inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Oil for decking oil <P1 yeah> oil for painting decks <P1 yes> or.\n",
      "[P1] Okay <E1 laughs>.\n",
      "[C4] Okay then uh you've answered the question thanks very much Woodies.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks <E1 okay then> Terry.\n",
      "[C4] Okay bye.\n",
      "[P1] There we are Terry's going to uh oil the deck as they say in the trade.\n",
      "[E1] He's not he's go he's unda {gunna} oil the handrails and posts and things <P1 right> because the deck's got terracotta tiles on it.\n",
      "[P1] Ah look tool of the week. Can I just uh we have uh my email has been down all week and I finally worked out how to change the uh the pop account which is a technical term <E2 mm> <E1 yeah> young people use to <E1 laughs> make people like me feel old <E1 and E2 yeah> and uh I've changed.\n",
      "[E2] Imagine how we feel Simon.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Well no you're <clears throat>.\n",
      "[E2] What's email <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] I'm o well I I'm only thirty-nine I don't know about you.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah I had to explain to Peter no that's a she male when he first told me about these <E1 ah yes yes> things <E2 laughs> yes y'know. Um no no no and and so but I did finally get them through at about uh nine o'clock this morning and one of <E2 the she mail> them says <E2 is that a sissy boy> I would like to nominate the uh is it okay just to ignore him <E2 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Just ignore him <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Yes just ignore him. Um give him it ritalin and he'll be fine <E2 yeah> <E1 yes>. Um <sound effect> <E1 and P1 laugh>. What was I saying. Yes that he would like to nominate the person that uh uploads the tool of the week onto the internet the world wide web as boofhead <E1 right> because they haven't been uploaded for uh six weeks now. And um I'm I'm it's not we've got the photos haven't we.\n",
      "[E1] Yes we've got the photos <P1 we've got the uh> and and we've got the text.\n",
      "[P1] Have we got the text.\n",
      "[E1] The the text but but it keeps on keeps on getting thrown back so I therefore <P1 oh okay> I sent it direct to you.\n",
      "[P1] Oh I haven't got it yet.\n",
      "[E1] Oh hasn't arrived.\n",
      "[P1] No <laughs>.\n",
      "[E2] Did you send it by email though <P1 inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] I sent it by email.\n",
      "[P1] Oh so we just say the boofhead's in the mail <E1 inaudible>. That's the new cho it's the new phrase <E1 okay> the boofhead and the cheque is in the mail <E1 clears throat>. Let's do the vuh tool of the week now <E1 laughs> and we get this one online <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Alright huh the <coughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Don't you meh dare mention that family <E1 and E2 laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] Oke <laughs>. Alright now the <coughs> the tool I have is is is a very very useful <P1 it's beautiful> D I Y tool.\n",
      "[P1] It looks nice <E2 mm>.\n",
      "[E1] It it it's used for <,> for detail plastering 'n' plaster repair <P1 mm> uh and the tool's quite small and it's called a plasterer's small tool. And it has a <sound effect> a small <P1 laughs> trowel shaped end on <P1 right> one end.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] And a rectangular face on the other.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Uh so that it's the same configuration.\n",
      "[P1] But it looks like a really mini trowel y'know how a trowel.\n",
      "[E1] But yeah like like like a little <inaudible> <P1 mm> like a little little mini trowel <E2 yeah> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] It's for tooling plaster into all sorts of little corners.\n",
      "[E1] Into into corners and crevices.\n",
      "[P1] While I say that there's no such thing as a carpenter's small tool is there Les.\n",
      "[E2] No they're built like.\n",
      "[E1] No <E2 yeah> no <inaudible> <P1 can I have a look at it> there isn't.\n",
      "[P1] So this is it's fine metal it's very beautifully made <E2 mm> is this a very expensive tool.\n",
      "[E1] No no no no no no no no that that um sort of under twenty dollars.\n",
      "[P1] You're kidding.\n",
      "[E2] It's like a mini trowel isn't it.\n",
      "[P1] Mini trowel so I can shape with with precision <E1 you're p dead right yeah> and then scrape the cah.\n",
      "[E1] And there's the fact thuh fact th the that the trowel shaped face is only about fifty millimetres long means that you can get into fine detail places and then on the other end <P1 mm> the the um the plasterer's trowel face where it's rectangular um it when it once again it's quite small so therefore you can get into small detailed areas.\n",
      "[P1] And and.\n",
      "[E1] It's a very very useful tool.\n",
      "[P1] As Diana Fisher on The Inventors used to say Alicia has now come up with another thing she says that it looks like a perfect baby cheesecake server.\n",
      "[E1] Mm well it is.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Al y alt alternatively.\n",
      "[P1] So it's got many uses around <E1 inaudible> the home.\n",
      "[E1] Al alternatively it's a baby cheesecake server.\n",
      "[P1] That's right.\n",
      "[E2] But it's a pretty it is a pretty thing isn't it funny how.\n",
      "[P1] So it's a tool for y'know evny {every/any} use any room in the house.\n",
      "[E2] When things when something uh does the job really well it usually looks good it's that <P1 yeah mm> form and function thing and it's <P1 it's very good> <,> that's one of those it's very pretty.\n",
      "[E1] Marvellous.\n",
      "[P1] And we'll take a photo of that and get it on the net for tool of the week.\n",
      "[P1] Very shortly John Hall along to uh do news headlines at twenty-eight minutes past ten. Couple of fridge suggestions Brian from beautiful Blacktown said he had a rust problem with his fridge he fixed it by cleaning it with a scourer. Then he got a pack of pressure pack paint from the hardware I'm sure he just said that so that <,> he could see whether <E1 yep yep>  I could say it <E2 yes> Peter Pider {Piper} picked a pecker {peck of}. He got a pack of pressure pack paint from the hardware that was four years ago and it's still all good.\n",
      "[E2] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Oh good.\n",
      "[P1] There we go Greg from Sefton says try some heavy cutting floor polish or car polish on the fridge and then use a finishing polish <E2 good> y'know the <E2 inaudible> cutting polish <E2 yeah> for a car.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah absolutely <P1 yeah> she should try that first actually 'cos it might ih.\n",
      "[P1] A little abrasive sort of is very soh not is <E2 yeah> yep. And then Robin from Illawong says cut out a piece of laminex <,> glue it on put plastic mouldings around the edges and hey hey no more rust. But you'd have to remove the rust first 'cos you don't want it to corrode underneath that do you.\n",
      "[E2] That'd look bloody awful.\n",
      "[P1] Would it.\n",
      "[E2] Uh that's a horrible idea <P1 inaudible> <E1 and E2 laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] Something to see Monday morning <E2 yes> um station manager Simon can you just explain why we lost Robin from Illawong as a listener <E1 laughs> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] Nothing personal Robin <all laugh>. No no don't give up your day job Robin <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> So there we are a couple of suggestions for the uh the rusty fridge and they'll be coming through as well. We'll find out about headlines next <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] And this is seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales.\n",
      "[E1] What colour is the laminex.\n",
      "[P1] That Robin wants to put on the uh.\n",
      "[E1] Yes fridge <P1 fridge> door.\n",
      "[P1] I reckon taupe would be nice <E2 yeah taupe>. Brown.\n",
      "[E2] Or <E1 Mission Brown> <P1 Mission Brown> gold gold with brown trim would be nice.\n",
      "[P1] Gold and then you could put little green around it <E2 yeah> and old photos from the two-thousand olympics and calls it call it your Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi fridge <E2 mm>. I think that'd be beautiful <E1 laughs>. Let's find out what's happening in the news headlines and a very good morning to John Hall.\n",
      "[P1] We look forward to it <E3 laughs>. And John.\n",
      "[E3] Standing by.\n",
      "[P1] Uh you I know that patiently throughout the whole morning you've had your all that zinc cream on your nose ready to go out and enjoy the daylight you can finally do it and just after the news at twelve.\n",
      "[E2] He's he's wearing his flippers already isn't he 'n' his <P1 he is> <E1 laughs> swimming goggles he just flaps out of the <inaudible> <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Don't let them stir you just <inaudible> <E2 inaudible> nice shirt John <E2 his little snorkel> I <,> <P1 beautiful shirt> I I like the shirt <P1 yes>. Very good.\n",
      "[E2] His Hawaiian shirt his snorkel his goggles his flippers and he just fl flaps <E1 he's not he's not wearing> <E1 inaudible> out up out <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Hey John <,>  Trisha McDonald said to say hello.\n",
      "[E3] Oh there's a blast from the past.\n",
      "[P1] Isn't it <E3 mm> I think we'd be talking Forbes Street days there.\n",
      "[E3] I think we might be.\n",
      "[P1] There we are sh.\n",
      "[E3] A long time ago.\n",
      "[P1] Emailed me this week and said that <E3 ah> you were the best weekend announcer ever.\n",
      "[E3] Well second best eh <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Quick as a flash.\n",
      "[P1] John Hall back at the news at eleven o'clock on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales June from Glebe has called in to say she's trying to buy <,> a triangular square which was the tool of the week from a while back and nobody knows what it is. You imagine 'scuse me I'd like to buy <E1 laughs> a triangular square well it's square madam no this one's triangular <E2 and P1 laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] Ih ih <coughs>.\n",
      "[P1] How many corners does it have <E1 yeah> ma'am it three well that's a triangle no I want a triangular square <E1 it it it it> what is the other name.\n",
      "[E1] It's bright yellow plastic.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] To identify it for you and uh.\n",
      "[P1] But what does she walk into the hardware store 'cos they are intimidating places <E1 yes> and they'll have a lend of you at any opportunity so she wants to walk in there and use the proper builder's term what is it.\n",
      "[E1] It's a s.\n",
      "[E2] It's actually a square but <E1 it it it's a square yeah> it's ih this particular one is in a triangular shape <E1 inaudible> <E1 the shape>. But the <P1 inaudible> but it has a the operative it has a ninety degree angle <,> one it's an isosceles triangle <laughs> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Isn't it. Isn't it yes it is you're right y.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah go <,> she should go in and say I want an isosceles triangle <E1 and E2 laugh> right where the square on <E1 so> the hypotenuse <E1 inaudible> equals the sum of the square on the other two sides <E1 inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] And this guy just draws on a piece of paper a triangle and says that'll be nine bucks thanks.\n",
      "[E1] Y yeah <laughs>.\n",
      "[E2] <laughs> That's right.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah just it it's bright yellow plastic. So y you ask for a bright yellow plastic square.\n",
      "[P1] A bright yellow <E1 mhm> plastic square. Which you use to measure\n",
      "[E2] In the shape of an isosceles triangle yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[E1] Uh and it's all she can do.\n",
      "[P1] They just get a laugh <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] Uh look well she's getting a photo off the internet isn't she of the thing she could take she could t download <P1 well yeah when that gets done> the photo and take it all <E1 inaudible>. Yeah if and <E1 inaudible> when that gets done because we always get around to doing the stuff we promise <E1 laughs>. Yes <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Yes Deirdre. Are you there Deirdre. In Coonabarabran. Deirdre.\n",
      "[P1] Oh is it.\n",
      "[C5] Yes.\n",
      "[P1] How are you.\n",
      "[C5] Oh well I'm well thank you.\n",
      "[P1] That's <C5 mhm> good. Sorry I got your name wrong.\n",
      "[C5] Oh that's alright Deirdre's a nice name.\n",
      "[P1] It is.\n",
      "[C5] Um I'm hoping you can help me I've I don't quite know how to describe this but I've inherited a a bentwood rocking chair big big one <P1 yeah> large one uh grandfather size.\n",
      "[P1] Oh good.\n",
      "[C5] Uh yes well it would be except the last owner the carers cared for the owner but not the chair.\n",
      "[P1] Ah so it needs some work.\n",
      "[C5] It needs some work it I didn't know whether to oil it because if I can describe you know the circles that they bend <E1 yeah> to infill the out outer rocker frame <E1 yep>. There are two circles and where they I don't know to call it a mitre it's not exactly a mitre but where this joins to make the circle <,> has come apart.\n",
      "[E1] Right yes yes.\n",
      "[C5] So there's a gap.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C5] And I don't know how to get it back also uh on the top it must've been rickety because they put two screws into the top through the bentwood wood which breaks my heart <,> but I don't know how to go about <E1 no the the> repairing.\n",
      "[E1] The two screws through the bentwood may well be standard that they they quite often um put a screw through the the bentwood frame to hold the two pieces together <C5 oh that might be what they've just put a> <C5 inaudible>. But uh I I I I wouldn't worry about that but but where the where the joint's come apart is the chair still sufficiently flexible that you can actually close it up again.\n",
      "[C5] No no it's not flexible.\n",
      "[E1] Alright okay well and and how wide's the gap.\n",
      "[C5] Oh about <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] A quarter of an inch.\n",
      "[C5] No it wouldn't be quarter oh yes about a quarter down to about an eighth.\n",
      "[E1] Okay um I I'd I'd be. I'd I think what I'd do is I'd just clean out any loose material in the gap <C5 yes>. And uh I'd very carefully mix up some uh some of that uh two pot glue some <inaudible> Araldite alright <C5 mhm>. Uh the the twenty-four hour one not the long term sorry about that but everybody makes <C5 okay> them the the two pot epoxy it might be a Bostik it might be a a Selleys suh w who h but they all they all make them.\n",
      "[C5] But won't that show uh as an in im in.\n",
      "[E1] Ih in yeah it it it will it'll be a a a dark grey colour when it dries.\n",
      "[C5] N no it's not the colour it's the s shape. Wouldn't it alter the curve of the the the circle.\n",
      "[E1] No what wuh <,> yuh 'n' 'n' ih thih this does not flex at all it it's it's still still lying quite normal.\n",
      "[C5] Mm except where it's making the gap is spoiling the circle.\n",
      "[E1] Oh I see <,> it it <C5 yeah> sounds like you need a n need somebody with cramp to actually <C5 yes> cramp the thing closed.\n",
      "[C5] Yes as long <E1 um> as it wouldn't break the wood then you know <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] No but just just I I'd it it won't c it won't be very expensive to have done.\n",
      "[C5] Ah.\n",
      "[E1] Juh juh juh just have a talk to um <C5 mhm> to to a a local cabinet maker <C5 uh> uh theh there's bound to be one in town or a carpenter in town <C5 well> it's a very easy job. And uh and all they'll do is that they'll put the the epoxy glue into the gap and then they'll close it up with a cramp and then it'll be back to normal shape.\n",
      "[C5] Yes well uh uh puh sort of do it gently uh <E1 that's what they'll do> a little bit at a time you mean.\n",
      "[E1] But but but a cramp will give them the control that they need to slowly close it up <C5 slowly> back into its place.\n",
      "[C5] I see yes I get it.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C5] Well thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] There's uh gotta be a good old woodworker somewhere around there.\n",
      "[E1] Ih ih it will <C5 inaudible> be worth having it done properly <C5 yes> because sounds like a lovely chair <C5 it's>. It may well be quite valuable.\n",
      "[C5] Yes I think perhaps it is.\n",
      "[E1] And and therefore if you.\n",
      "[C5] Anyway it's very comfortable.\n",
      "[E1] Ih if you do <C5 laughs> something slipshod it <C5 yes> it devalues it.\n",
      "[C5] Exactly exactly.\n",
      "[P1] There's gotta be somebody up at the Pilliga state forest round there that works in wood that would be able to help you out.\n",
      "[C5] Well I'll try.\n",
      "[P1] Alright good look with <C5 thank you> it.\n",
      "[C5] Thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you.\n",
      "[E2] <inaudible> pull it together with just <E1 yeah ih> rope it up and then and tighten and <E1 yep yep yeah but but> pull it together with the rope.\n",
      "[E1] The thing is that you see that that that while the rope would do that it doesn't give you the control <P1 same control yeah>. And and we what we need to close up in in this funny configuration is to control of a couple of cramps.\n",
      "[P1] Ian from Lismore wants to know where you get the appliance white paint that the Woodies mentioned earlier is that just a generic line name.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah ih it's.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah it's <E1 it it's> not a tr it's not a trade name.\n",
      "[E1] It's a it's a pressure pack and once again every <inaudible> <E2 specialist paint store> it's actually called <P1 specialist paint stores> it it's called <P1 appliance white> appliance white.\n",
      "[P1] Appliance white <E1 mm>. And also as far as w what the triangular square is <,> from the tool of the week <E1 uh> earlier <,> we've had a couple of suggestions Sandy who um <,> says that she knows one of the Woodies uh very well.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Yeah go on.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Is Les gunna <E1 yes yes> have a good time when he gets home. He's gunna be teased about this all weekend Sandy rang to say d'oh it's called a quick square.\n",
      "[E1] Go on.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] I I <P1 no> I I'm not going down this path <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] You're not going down this one. And Rod from Homebush r called in to say if you walk in and ask for a <E2 set square> sixty-thirty set square <E2 yeah absolutely> uh you'll be right <E2 yeah> and Rob also pointed out that that shape is a scalene triangle Woodies.\n",
      "[E2] Scalene eh.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] But but I think that the quick square is isosceles anyway <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Ah yes and we have a boofhead of the week coming up uh Dawn's on the line in h Illihong {Illawong} Dawn.\n",
      "[E2] Scalene I thought that was that that dry skin you get on on the elbow y'know.\n",
      "[P1] No.\n",
      "[P1] No it's a <P1 no> set square.\n",
      "[P1] Scalene was the she male you were talking <laughs> to in the <E2 yes> pub last night <laughs>.\n",
      "[E2] Scalene the she male yes <all laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] Dawn's on the line in Illawong how are you Dawn.\n",
      "[P1] I love this the way it's been put up on the screen can her ol can your old deck be put in the log fire.\n",
      "[C6] Well that's right yes it's one of those combustion fires.\n",
      "[P1] Right.\n",
      "[C6] But it has been painted with that um uh uh y'know paint that they use for outdoors on decking.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C6] And I'm just wondering would there be any fumes or anything <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Fumes is it safe.\n",
      "[E2] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[E2] Painted with when you say paint is it an oil that it's been painted with.\n",
      "[C6] Um oh what's that <E2 coating> coverall that uh.\n",
      "[E2] Just a deck paint or something.\n",
      "[C6] Yeah.\n",
      "[E2] Mm.\n",
      "[E1] I I wouldn't not for sake of anything except for the pitch that it may well form on the inside of the chimney <C6 oh right>. And it may well um <,> cause a fire on the inside of the chimney flue.\n",
      "[C6] Oh I see.\n",
      "[E1] I I'm I w I don't think I'd be worried about it being inside the fire because <C6 no> the door's shut 'n' <C6 yeah> uh et cetera cetera cetera but I think that I would avoid using it in the fire because I'd be concerned that the oily nature of the material that's been used to paint it might cause some some ex.\n",
      "[P1] Ah it'll build up.\n",
      "[E1] E excessive build-up within the chimney flue.\n",
      "[P1] Good call.\n",
      "[C6] Do you think if I um if I just used it sparingly along with other wood not sort of just burn that alone do you think that might be <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Uh I I I would still recommend against it <C6 inaudible> because over the period of time <C6 mm> the same amount of <P1 mm> material will be burned and the same amount of of uh material will go up the flue.\n",
      "[C6] Oh right <E1 and> actually <E1 but but> I'm I'm planning on getting rid of the fire after this winter so <E1 mm> I wouldn't be worrying after that but.\n",
      "[E2] Well burn it then.\n",
      "[C6] So it would be alright just for one season.\n",
      "[E2] Uh.\n",
      "[E1] I I'm I I'm just concerned about about the <E2 mm> inside of the flue becoming um a fire hazard.\n",
      "[C6] Right.\n",
      "[E1] That's all.\n",
      "[C6] Okay.\n",
      "[E2] Is it a is it a metal flue is a brick f.\n",
      "[C6] Yes a metal flue.\n",
      "[E1] Uh just I'm a nervuh <E2 mm> I I'm a nervous old coot that's all.\n",
      "[C6] Yes <E2 mm> so am I.\n",
      "[E2] 'Cos if it's just a thin coating uh was it oh by the way is a was it a a treated pine deck to start with or a hardwood.\n",
      "[C6] Uh hardwood.\n",
      "[E2] Oh right if it's treated pine <E1 mm> then absolutely don't burn it.\n",
      "[C6] No no <E1 mm> it's hardwood.\n",
      "[P1] 'Cos that <E1 um> treatment then it's fine <C6 inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] Mm mm. Um yeah yeah <C6 so> so if well I wouldn't be as nervous as Les about it but it's still with some reservations I'd <C6 right> uh uh but if you've gettih getting rid of the fire next year anyway.\n",
      "[C6] Uh I'm a just going to keep it this winter and then I'm used to l uh rid of it.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah and uh y y c <laughs> yeah it's such a good s it's there it is it's firewood and <E1 laughs> it's oh it's a teaser isn't it.\n",
      "[C6] <inaudible> and there's just so much of it that um it'd be great if I could burn it you know and not just um <E2 yeah> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] Why don't you just have a little fire just in a little drum or something in the backyard and have a look burn it and see if any black s smoh any if it burns nice and and cleanly <C6 mm>. Uh and you'd see no pr n uh doesn't produce any kind of s serious smoke or black smoke <C6 alright> or white smoke then it's probably okay.\n",
      "[P1] Dawn what we're a what <E2 and smell it as well> this is the radio equivalent of what you used to see in cartoons where the person'd be wondering <E1 laughs> whether to do it and you get the little angel on one shoulder <E2 yes> and you've got the little devil <C6 that's right> at the other. And <C6 no what> essentially what it comes down to is you've gotta see who you trust most.\n",
      "[E2] Yes.\n",
      "[C6] Okay then.\n",
      "[E2] But have <E1 laughs> a practise burn in a drum and see if it burns nice <C6 I will I> and cleanly why not.\n",
      "[C6] Well that sounds a good idea I'll start with that anyway.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah <P1 ac> see she's an adventurer she wants to <P1 good on you Dawn> she wants to <,> live on edge <E1 laughs> right she wants to walk the tightrope <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Fire's burning.\n",
      "[P1] Sixteen away from eleven on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney uh Paul from Tullaburgill Tullibigeal sorry <,> is on the line is that right Paul.\n",
      "[P1] And y apparently you're an expert on all sorts of squares and set squares.\n",
      "[C7] Well it sorta comes through because I remember seeing a parallel when I went to school I did tech drawing and I did woodwork and in both classes <P1 yes> the piece of plastic or wood that had a ninety degree angle on one corner <P1 yes> was referred to as a set square <P1 yeah set square yeah>. You used it to set the square angle in a drawing or whatever.\n",
      "[P1] Uh yep.\n",
      "[C7] And the other square that is commonly used which is basically shaped like two bits of material wood or steel <,> uh and you use it to try the edge of a piece of material.\n",
      "[E2] Is a try square.\n",
      "[P1] That's called a try square.\n",
      "[C7] Is a try square you got it.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah. He's absolutely c he's absolutely right.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah but <C7 and when you> but but <cough> but.\n",
      "[C7] And when somebody wants to repaint their fridge <P1 yes> all they've gotta do is stand back and bomb the thing with some white automotive paint.\n",
      "[P1] Bomb it <laughs> that's a nice technique so ih spray it with the white automotive paint.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah yeah that you don't need special fridge paint y'know just ordinary white automotive paint'll do the job nicely.\n",
      "[E1] Uh it it would it will tend to be a bit stark and white and may therefore stand out like a neon light against the remainder of the fridge body.\n",
      "[C7] Perhaps so but you could also repaint the fridge with any one of a plethora of colours available in the automotive paint catalogue.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Or probably <E2 oh you could have> have a <,> mustang orange <E1 I'd agree with that> <inaudible> with a G T stripe.\n",
      "[E1] Put a V eight sign on it and.\n",
      "[P1] Put a little sticker <E1 point-seven-nine> this fridge is rocking <E2 laughs> don't bother knocking.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Or y'know don't laugh it might be your daughter in here.\n",
      "[E1] <inaudible> yes for your cool daughter.\n",
      "[P1] It is fifteen minutes away from eleven on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney after eleven Tony Delroy Leo k Leon Compton and Jen Fleming look back at the week on the wireless got a few calls to get through and we'll see how quickly we can do it 'cos Linda's been waiting very patiently in Wahroonga well Linda how are you.\n",
      "[P1] Your parquetry floor is cupping.\n",
      "[C8] Yes it is.\n",
      "[P1] Ah what can we do <C8 it's to do with the laying> with a cupping floor <E2 mm> Woodies.\n",
      "[E2] Are the are the each little bits of parquetry cupping individually or or there are larger sections of <,> uh y'know uh a whole bunch of boards cupping.\n",
      "[C8] The whole floor. They're slightly cupping it's newly laid <E2 right>. What I'm wondering if we get the installer back <E2 yeah> and he sands it all and does it again will that solve it.\n",
      "[E1] No.\n",
      "[E2] Ih it it may provided all other things are equal Les is shaking his head but um is ih was it laid onto a concrete slab.\n",
      "[C8] Yes.\n",
      "[E2] Um and were any tests done on the slab to see whether it was uh dry enough to <,> to to be ready to lay the parquetry.\n",
      "[C8] Well what they did firstly <E2 mm> was they had a sort of a rubber membrane that they <E2 yeah> put all over the floor to stop any moisture coming up through the slab <E2 yeah>. That was meant to dry overnight virtually <E2 yeah>. It took two weeks to dry <E2 mm>. And then they came out again and put another rubber membrane over it <E2 yeah>. It dried quicker and then they laid the parquetry on top.\n",
      "[E2] Is it a large area.\n",
      "[C8] Yes.\n",
      "[E2] Mm y yeah this one it should be looked at by a building consultant I think just <,> because there are a couple of possibilities the the whatever product was used on the floor may have re-emulsified and and not actually ever dried um uh there are some issues that should be that should be looked at on a hands on situation by a building consultant I think.\n",
      "[E1] I'll bet any money th the house is air conditioned <E2 mm>.\n",
      "[C8] Uh yes it is.\n",
      "[E2] Mm mm.\n",
      "[C8] But this this started before the ih with before <E1 yeah you see no see what> we started using the air conditioning.\n",
      "[E1] See what's happening what's happening is this <E2 mm>. That there's a moisture content in the parquetry material and that moisture content or the humidity of the of the interior of the wood m m declares that that that the wood is of a certain shape and size and the air conditioning is almost certainly upsetting the uh the humidity in that area um is the is the part that's affected in the room that's air conditioned.\n",
      "[C8] Well with the air conditioning this was installed last July we've neh <E1 mm> ih this cupping started before we s even turned <E1 mm> on the air conditioning <E1 yeah alright> it's in the house.\n",
      "[E1] Uh well then it but it's nonetheless being caused by <,> variations to the humidity in the room and hyuh and variations therefore to the size of the pieces of parquetry. They're expanding and contracting <C8 uhuh> because they're real wood <,> um.\n",
      "[E2] But if it's cupping and peaking Les it's mainly suh uh absorbing moisture rather than <E1 oh for sure> losing it and <E1 for sure> and it's absorbing it from somewhere and it's just difficult for us to say for certain that that isn't from the slab underneath for some reason.\n",
      "[E1] I think that <E2 uh> a building consultant would be money well spent.\n",
      "[E2] Mm.\n",
      "[C8] Uh who should I contact then.\n",
      "[E2] Well there is <,> there.\n",
      "[P1] Should have ringed that favour <E2 laughs> in.\n",
      "[E2] You can contact the Institute of Building Consultants.\n",
      "[C8] Mhm.\n",
      "[P1] So <E2 um> they're the umbrella body.\n",
      "[E2] Uh that's one of them and the Master Builder's Association also have accredited consultants and they can recommend someone in your area.\n",
      "[C8] Mhm.\n",
      "[P1] The Institute of Building Consultants' number is have you got a pen.\n",
      "[C8] Uh y yes.\n",
      "[P1] It's a Sydney number <,> n.\n",
      "[C8] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] Nine-six-five-one.\n",
      "[C8] Uhuh.\n",
      "[P1] Two-nine-seven-five.\n",
      "[C8] Uhuh.\n",
      "[P1] Nine-six-five-one-two-nine-seven-five they'll recommend a building consultant and it is good so that when you do have the person that laid the parquetry floor come back in you've got a s independent uh <E2 mm> finding on it and you both of you can work together to <C8 mhm> fix the problem <E1 the> in your best interest.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah there's a lot better.\n",
      "[E2] <inaudible> that he mucked up the job I wouldn't like say for certain without you can't say <E1 inaudible> without seeing it.\n",
      "[E1] The expertise <E2 mm> uh that the building consultant brings to the argument is worth the money.\n",
      "[C8] Uhuh.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[C8] Uh what another quick question uh this um installer had insurance <E2 yep> and I I thought well we're gunna be fine if there's a problem <E2 yeah> <E1 well> but hih psh insurance with H I A and they said it doesn't cover faulty workmanship.\n",
      "[P1] Again this <E2 mm> is a matter for the building consultant to work out can he advise on that.\n",
      "[E2] They'll advise on uh they'll look at that whatever inshu uh insurance uh is available to you um yeah absolutely to some extent but really wuh it gets there's a fine line sometimes if it comes at becomes a legal problem and then you need to get legal advice from <C8 uhuh> a solicitor.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C8] Uhuh.\n",
      "[E2] Building consultant usually tells you what the problem is with the uh with the job and if that pr a and if it's a mistake or an error by the installers <C8 mhm>. They'll tell you that much 'n' they'll give you some hints on uh where you can go with the Department of Fair Trading 'n' what have you but then you uh if it if it gets to that you see your solicitor hopefully.\n",
      "[C8] Alright then.\n",
      "[E2] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[C8] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Linda.\n",
      "[C8] Thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Good luck with it.\n",

      "[P1] Terry from Bathurst has rung in to say that he had a rusty fridge problem and I like this one. So what he did he painted the rusty fridge with blackboard paint and now he can write his s shopping on the fridge <E2 laughs>. It's really hard to fit the fridge in his pocket when he goes <E2 yes> out.\n",
      "[E1] I like a man with a solution for everything weh well done mate well done.\n",
      "[P1] That is good uh Bob's on the line in Croydon how are you Bob.\n",
      "[P1] Very well you wanna get French polish off the table.\n",
      "[C9] Yes yes I um my sister bought a table and I acted the expert and thought I knew how to do it.\n",
      "[P1] Uh oh.\n",
      "[C9] And uh just want a bit of advice <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] What have you done so far.\n",
      "[C9] Haven't touched it yet but I thought I'd uh take to it with some steel wool and metho.\n",
      "[E1] Do you intend to refurbish it or strip it off completely.\n",
      "[C9] Strip it off completely.\n",
      "[E1] First hire a stripper oops <P1 laughs> buh duh duh.\n",
      "[P1] Duh duh duh <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> We won't go there.\n",
      "[P1] No.\n",
      "[E1] Uh uh the the it's why not.\n",
      "[E2] I love talking about strippers <all laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] Not that sort of stripper Peter <E2 yes> just just down boy down down down. Gee <laughs>.\n",
      "[E2] What's wrong with nude women Les what have you got against <sound effect>.\n",
      "[E1] Hope you like the tablets.\n",
      "[P1] There we go <E2 medication> another <E1 I I> <E1 coughs> ritalin.\n",
      "[E1] I I <coughs> another ritalin yeah I I I'd be inclined to uh ih {break} if the if the French polish that's on it now uh is the kind of finish that you intend to replace it with um and it's not badly perished well then what you're gunna do with the with the the steel wool and the <,> and the methylated spirits will work as long as you work along the grain <C9 yeah>. Be very easy with the steel wool to to make circular scratches that are s that are there forever <C9 yeah>. Um uh I I I think that I'd probably be more inclined to use an ordinary commercial stripper.\n",
      "[C9] Oh okay.\n",
      "[E1] That because it's designed for the purpose and all the metho'll do is soften the French polish <,> where um the strip the stripper will be will completely destroy it and will come away without any trouble um th there there are <,> th there's a um a stripper that that you can what's that that one you paint on and peel off Pete.\n",
      "[E2] Oh um the strip uh wuh peel away system.\n",
      "[E1] Now the peel away system <C9 oh> uh the that that that might do you do you very well on on a piece like this because you maintain such good controls of it.\n",
      "[C9] Okay and.\n",
      "[E1] You're you're only only gunna do this to the top aren't you.\n",
      "[C9] Uh no the whole thing.\n",
      "[E1] Oh no well ih well ih well then just use any old stripper 'n' and strip the whole lot whole lot and hose it off <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[C9] Okay and in terms of finishing it it's a t I think it's Tasmanian blackbutt <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Go on.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[C9] <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Looks like we. You you've lost these other pair go on <P1 no no> I yeah I'm with you.\n",
      "[C9] Completely haven't I.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah they're gone.\n",
      "[C9] What would I finish it with she wants something fairly durable and hard.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Uh uh m make sure that <C9 he's just still> you get.\n",
      "[C9] Got his mind <E1 but> on stripper hasn't he <all laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] Theh theh theh they've gone down a very bad path here the pair of them.\n",
      "[C9] Yeah <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Let's recap <E1 inaudible> we want any old stripper with a black butt.\n",
      "[E1] No we don't we want <all laugh> t any old stripper with a black butt. Now now look <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Guys keep it clean come <E1 yeah> on please.\n",
      "[E1] Now now <,> it's very incuh important that you that you get the basis of the material clean you get all of the <,> the stripped material off first. Um y wuh when you were talking about using fine steel wool before if you do go down that path with the st fine steel wool you want the oh-oh-oh-oh steel wool.\n",
      "[C9] Right.\n",
      "[E1] Um don't don't use the stuff that you use for your kitchen kitchen pots and pans <C9 no> because that will scratch it.\n",
      "[P1] Proper really fine oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.\n",
      "[E1] And <,> and having removed all of the <,> all the old material um you could use a just a a uh a satin polyurethane if you wanted to.\n",
      "[C9] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] It buh it'd be hard wearing <C9 yeah> um. Oh {break} I I I wouldn't go back to French polish again <,> what what sort of table is it.\n",
      "[C9] Uh ih dining room table.\n",
      "[E1] Is it expensive is it <C9 um> valuable.\n",
      "[C9] I think it's uh a family type table.\n",
      "[P1] Oh yes.\n",
      "[E1] Ih ih w well t just just before you attack it too severely make sure that you're not devaluing a valuable piece of furniture because the the moment that you take the French polish off and put polyurethane on um there are those who would certainly say that you'd devalued the <P1 mm> the quality the of the furniture.\n",
      "[P1] You get your sister to sign a a deed of release saying that that that you've rel released from any responsibility at all <E1 laughs> before starting the job <all laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] Oh dear me.\n",
      "[P1] No he could.\n",
      "[E1] But I I'd <P1 do you> I'd I would strip it with a stripper.\n",
      "[C9] Thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[E1] Anh anh and then I'd remove any of the old material with a <,> with a um uh {break} piece of steel wool and methylated spirits. And the steel wool and metho will of course will remove the last uh residual of polish and then a light sanding with s say about two-hundred-and-forty or three-hundred-and-forty grade aluminium oxide paper. That's that white abrasive paper <C9 mhm> and and then uh some satin polyurethane.\n",
      "[C9] That sounds great thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] And will you let us know how it goes.\n",
      "[C9] Will.\n",
      "[P1] There we go and also waiting very patiently on the line in Nowra Joan good morning.\n",
      "[P1] Oh yes <E1 and E2 laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Oh as consolation for being for doing for waiting so long we'll send you down a left handed hammer okay.\n",
      "[C10] Thank you very much <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] And a sky hook.\n",
      "[C10] Oh thank you.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Are you.\n",
      "[C10] Look um we're looking at buying um a fairly old house about thirty years old and it's fibro lined. Um <,> uh I'm not too sure of the distan the difference between asbestos and fibro I want to know are there any uh concerns for health reasons or.\n",
      "[P1] It's a good question.\n",
      "[E2] Look it's safe {break} in that form it does if it's that old and it's ih ih fibro simply a fibre cement sheet where the the strengthening fibres within the cement encased within the cement are asbestos fibres. Now if you it's dangerous if you drill it um y'know mm mm huh tamper with it such that you produce um dust and and all that sort of stuff but if it's just sitting there and painted it's fine every f.\n",
      "[P1] If it's unbroken <E2 yeah> and in a whole piece.\n",
      "[E2] Every fibro house in Sydney's got asbestos in it <C10 okay> every old fibro house has.\n",
      "[E1] If you're gunna paint {break} theh use you y use a plastic spatula ra rather than a s a steel spatula. Don't sand it um you w you want to avoid disturbing the surface of the asbestos.\n",
      "[E2] Mm.\n",
      "[C10] It looks fine as a matter of fact I wouldn't have picked it up to be fibro y'know until it was {break} pointed out to me it's a really good job <E1 yeah> but if we decided to plaster it wuh could you plaster over the top.\n",
      "[E2] Over the top yep.\n",
      "[C10] Straight <E1 over the paint> over the top.\n",
      "[E2] Yep yep.\n",
      "[P1] As long as you bear in mind you're not gunna do anything that disturbs the surface.\n",
      "[E2] No she doesn't mean plastering I think she's talking about putting plasterboard <C10 yes> you would put a plasterboard over the top nailing through to the studs and that would be fine.\n",
      "[C10] Okay now wuh there is one little wall small wall we want to take down would you take the sheets out as whole.\n",
      "[E2] Yep.\n",
      "[P1] Well then when you start working with fibro there are guidelines aren't there Peter.\n",
      "[E2] There are WorkCover um provides the uh the guidelines for how to dispose of it 'n' 'n' how to deal with it but the best thing to do is to take it off in the largest possible size sheets so that you'd punch you'd find the fixing nails <E1 inaudible> <C10 yeah> punch them through and then lift the sheet away use y'know wear a mask and just vacuum up everything and maybe even just slightly dampen the <,> the the proh take it out and then you get a licensed rubbish removalist to remove it and that's no.\n",
      "[P1] 'Cos you c definitely can't just throw it in the bin either.\n",
      "[E2] No.\n",
      "[C10] And is that expensive to get <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] Uh it's not that much more expensive I mean if you were if it say that normally the rubbish removal's gunna be two-hundred it might be two-hundred-and-fifty.\n",
      "[C10] Right.\n",
      "[E2] It's that sort of thing all they do is wrap it in plastic and take it to um where are you.\n",
      "[C10] Oh Nowra.\n",
      "[P1] Nowra.\n",
      "[E2] Oh right well they take it to a a a tip that um bury it basically.\n",
      "[C10] Yeah I I pictured them turning up in those big plastic suits and.\n",
      "[E2] No.\n",
      "[P1] Oh in the white suits <E2 no no no no> and they put a whole plastic sheet over the house and wear <C10 no> breathing equipment no <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E2] And take out your two sheets of fibro no.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah not E T <C10 inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Play spooky music.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah no it's not as bad as that but it ih it l y'know you need to be.\n",
      "[P1] It's good to be very aware of it.\n",
      "[E2] And prudent when you're dea when you're dealing <P1 but> with it.\n",
      "[P1] You don't need to be f frightened of it and there is a lot of information on that WorkCover site.\n",
      "[C10] Does it devalue a property ih like if ih ih um when you resell or.\n",
      "[E2] Look it may a little bit I guess but only because ih ih it was <C10 inaudible> it was probably an inexpensive way of getting of of of lining an interior of the house really it's more to do with that n rather than the fact that it's fibro it's just not as good an insulator 'n' <C10 yeah> um mm would be <C10 inaudible> better if if down the track you you put plasterboard over the top of it.\n",
      "[C10] It'll be fine.\n",
      "[E2] Is it ceilings and walls.\n",
      "[C10] As far uh we're not we haven't really checked the ceilings <E2 yeah> but you can see um a crack right along not a crack you know <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Are the ceilings {break} battened or.\n",
      "[C10] <inaudible> right along one sheet which maybe it is maybe <E1 mm mm mm> that's plaster not sure.\n",
      "[E2] No but it's pretty safe if you don't tamper with it and um.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah <,> it's certainly not something you'd say oh I'm not gunna buy that house 'cos of fibro if if <E1 inaudible> you like the house <E1 yeah> you like where it is it's what you can afford <E1 ah yeah> <C10 yeah> <E1 inaudible> go ahead.\n",
      "[C10] Thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "[C10] That was worth waiting for.\n",
      "[P1] And make sure you find out about WorkCover 'cos that's they've got a lot of information there.\n",
      "[C10] Alright then thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Joan.\n",
      "[C10] Thank you bye.\n",
      "[P1] Enjoy the long wait.\n",
      "[C10] Thank you\n",
      "[P1] There you go <all laugh> {break} down in Nowra.\n",
      "[E2] We'll send you some multicoloured paint some rainbow.\n",
      "[P1] Rainbow paint'd be <E2 yeah> beautiful on the fibro wouldn't it.\n",
      "[E2] Bit of black and white maybe.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah some black and white paint that sounds really good Tony Delroy Leon Compton and Jen Fleming up after the news apologies to Paula and Jacintha uh w I might even ask the guys if they'll answer the phone during the noise but right now it is eleven o'clock <,> news time.\n",
      "ABCE3-raw.txt\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> It's like being at school. And we talk about a book which is just like every other book club and I really just started this because I wanted to be in a book club and <P2 laughs> nobody would ask me so I thought I'd start my own.\n",
      "[P2] And so yes.\n",
      "[P1] Wo we run.\n",
      "[P2] We ask everybody <P1 to join our>. Bit like Marilyn Monroe isn't it we want everybody to <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] To like us <P2 yeah> love us yes. The Lovely Bones you loved and I didn't really.\n",
      "[P2] Oh look it's so funny isn't it <P1 but> did you want to tell that story like how much Jurate hated this book and so let's do it for book club <P1 laughs>. And then Jurate changed her mind.\n",
      "[P1] And Lynne takes an opposite view <P2 mm> so we will explore all this in its fascinating complexity. Alright Jurate you give us the plot what happens in The Lovely Bones.\n",
      "[P2] Well The Lovely Bones basically is narrated by Susie Salmon like the fish <P1 as she says> who's. As she says yes I didn't make that up and she's a fourteen year old and within the first few lines of the book we discover that she was raped and murdered in nineteen-seventy-three. Now she is in a place called heaven which she later discovers is kind of a bit like limbo actually it's not quite heaven heaven it is for people or souls rather who still cling to life on earth so what um Susie does from heaven from her vantage point of heaven is to observe in the next eight years as the plot goes on what happens to her family her mother father very young much younger brother and young sister the policeman mainly involved in her case and of course her murderer. So we get to see how all these people cope with the aftermath of a really horrid violent tragic event in their lives and how they grow uh cuh each very individually and very differently cope with grief <P1 mhm>. And that's the bare bones.\n",
      "[P1] Yes as opposed to The Lovely Bones <P2 mm> now yes we should point out that you didn't like it when you first read it <P2 no> a couple of years ago.\n",
      "[P2] But I suspect it's for the same reasons you didn't like it this time.\n",
      "[P1] Which are.\n",
      "[P2] Well for me I thought it was the most offensively saccharine vision of heaven I had ever read <laughs> what do you reckon.\n",
      "[P1] Well you thought that because ih uh in Susie Salmon's heaven everybody determines their own heaven if you like.\n",
      "[P2] Yes and you have the people that you want to encounter or they want to encounter you in their heaven and ih it looks like um somewhere that you I suppose feel safe and <P1 yes> and happy and comfortable. So if you're young if you're a fourteen year old in Susie's case it's her local high school but there are no teachers you know there are plenty of dogs playing around she manages to conjure her um life her gar well her death guide I suppose you'd say who's an older woman <P1 guardian angel> she realises like a mother figure angel. Um she f gets a friend they have slightly different versions but you know come together in the same version I mean it made me feel a bit sick the first time I read it I thought this is wrong this is.\n",
      "[P1] Why why did you think that bit was so wrong.\n",
      "[P2] Well <P1 see that that didn't actually> <P1 inaudible> just felt American to me actually.\n",
      "[P1] Yes well it was it was <P2 terrible to> <P1 inaudible> a fourteen year old high school vision yes of heaven. But uh I suppose <,> that was a little twee for me but.\n",
      "[P2] Twee.\n",
      "[P1] Twee is right yes yes. But that's not the thing that I found most annoying.\n",
      "[P2] Come on tell me.\n",
      "[P1] No let's take some calls <both laugh> Rick Rick's in Mccrae good afternoon Rick.\n",
      "[P1] Hi you loved it.\n",
      "[C1] I did I had a fantastic time reading about a number I've I've listened you I'm a talking book and I've listened to it several times and it gets better every time.\n",
      "[P1] And and was there anything specific that really stuck with you from it Rick.\n",
      "[C1] There ih there um one thing I I felt that uh 'cos I don't want to spoil it for people have uh haven't read it is but um I like the way that uh the murderer had uh um came to grief in the end.\n",
      "[P1] That was <P2 yes> excellent.\n",
      "[C1] In the very end. And I like the way he did that happen to him and I thought good.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah he's been dispatched.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah exactly.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah good point Rick he does come to um uh an appropriate termination twenty-three past two hi Sarah.\n",
      "[P2] Didn't you.\n",
      "[C2] Well I didn't.\n",
      "[P1] She was a bit frustrated <C2 inaudible> 'cos she wanted to be on earth didn't she.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah yeah.\n",
      "[P2] She was bored.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah she was bored so that's why I didn't think it was saccharine.\n",
      "[P2] I know uh well Sarah if I can just interrupt <P1 laughs> sorry but I must say that it's interesting because a couple of years ago when I first read it I had all those reactions and thought it was too much and really icky and this time I didn't think so at all. So I think it so much depends doesn't it where <P1 you are> you are <P1 mm> when you read something and what expectations you have of the plot as well and must say this time I actually thought contextually it fitted very well and I didn't find it over sort of sweet either. I think I must have been in a very particular mood a while ago.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Couple of years ago when you first read it.\n",
      "[P2] Yeah <P1 do> what else Sarah.\n",
      "[C2] Uh <,> I was going to say I'd ih I couldn't put it down for a start I was read I can't normally read in the car but I was reading it you know as a passenger of course.\n",
      "[P1] Oh I was gunna say <laughs>.\n",
      "[C2] It was just one of those that kept me up late at night 'cos I didn't want to stop reading.\n",
      "[P1] Right.\n",
      "[C2] And once I'd got through the uh awful bits.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[C2] The gory bits.\n",
      "[P1] And they are pretty grim.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah it was pretty hard to get through that <P1 yeah> but I'd it just left me with an overall sense of <,> um this sounds saccharine but beauty I just I had <P1 mm> tears running down my face when I finished <P1 mm>.\n",
      "[P2] Oh nice.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] I r I did read one uh comment about it saying that ih ih was it was full of grace which I think is probably fair. And maybe what you mean by beauty in a way Sarah.\n",
      "[P2] Yes yes.\n",
      "[C2] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] That notion of of um  <,> acceptance and uh wise or great wisdom and and tolerance and all those things it does give you hope. Thanks a lot for your comments Sarah very insightful now I'll tell you why I didn't like it shall I.\n",
      "[P2] Yes tell me.\n",
      "[P1] It wasn't the heaven bit that that struck me as as ghastly <laughs> I didn't find that too bad 'cos I just ih kind of <P2 mm> accepted that fourteen year old Susie Salmon <,> was just your archetypal American girl so that's how her heaven would look but it bothered me when the plotline pursuing Mr Harvey <P2 mm> her murder and rapist fell away.\n",
      "[P2] Ah.\n",
      "[P1] I felt the pace dropped dramatically <P2 ah that's interesting> at that stage and I struggled to move through it.\n",
      "[P2] So you would've preferred to find out more about him <P1 well> and his.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah and I felt <P2 mm> felt it was sort of half and half and I wondered if Alice Sebold really knew what she wanted there 'cos it struck me that the gear changed it it started out as a pretty page turning crime investigation at the beginning <P2 mhm> those y'know bits of clues turning up and <,> Len Fenerman the the policeman <P2 yes> coming in and out of the story and then it moved into this exploration of grief which in itself was quite valid and interesting but the two sort of sandwiched together to me didn't quite gel.\n",
      "[P2] But don't you think because it does take place over eight years and naturally an uh I mean obviously Susie could go on to observe other murders <P1 mm> and we do have a character also in the novel called Ruth who is um supposedly psychic and she actually does sense other people who have been raped and murdered mainly women and children and um I mean there are parts of that that I have a little bit of difficulty dih with <laughs> <P1 and another>. You should see the face Lynne is making um <laughs> and but I you know what I really liked about it. Sorry to change the subject but I really liked her observations of daily life.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah and I would accept that <P2 yeah um> I think that's good.\n",
      "[P2] Okay it's flawed ih thih I think it's probably a deeply flawed first novel and m perhaps we should tell the listeners as well I don't know if everyone realises that Alice Sebold was actually raped <,> herself and in fact the first book she wrote was a book called Lucky and that actually tells about her own experience and she and subsequent trial of the fellow who raped her. Now she calls it Lucky because she of course survived <P1 mm> and she survived without any um gruesome physical you know anything happen well apart from the obvious happening to her but I think the fellow had actually <,> physically um harmed other women quite violently and badly so in her case she felt very lucky to <P1 mm> to have survived. So I think I mean ih it's interesting I wonder how that has actually influenced this novel.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[P2] But also how much desire there must be to actually makes something good out of such a bad experience.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah it does give you another <,> < P2 perspective you know yeah> perspective on on the on the novel that's for sure and I'll go on to be boring in my nit picking in just a moment. Liz is in Anglesea hi Liz.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[C3] I don't know and she said b she started to read it in a plane on her way to a um a conference cried in the plane was a bit embarrassed that she was crying in public and but she said it was best book she ever read so I sent one to my niece in France. Who lives in France and doesn't get a lot of good.\n",
      "[P1] English <C3 novels> books yeah.\n",
      "[C3] And uh every time I go to read it because I knew it was about murder I'd I read in night time have no wish to have nightmares <P1 no> <inaudible> find a daytime to read them.\n",
      "[P1] Yes <laughs>.\n",
      "[C3] But she said it was she r she's a prolific reader. And she said it was the best book she'd ever read.\n",
      "[P1] Okay Liz <C3 inaudible> well I'm just trying to think of when you're gunna have a chance to read it that won't um <C3 oh I'll> interrupt your night's sleep.\n",
      "[C3] I'll watch myself down the beach one day.\n",
      "[P1] Good.\n",
      "[C3] Have a read.\n",
      "[P1] Okay well I hope we don't spoil it for you.\n",
      "[C3] Oh no no it's fine because she gave me the uh nitty gritty of it but it's interesting because she ih um she's a very um ih wih oh she's a very prolific reader <P1 mm> I have to say has read y'know from classics down to novels all the time. Knocks books over very quickly. Um I just thought it was very interesting the your perspective against against what she'd told me.\n",
      "[P1] Yes well there are parts of it that I think work really really well and um as as Jurate has has stoutly defended <P2 laughs> Alice Sebold I think some of her observations of people and circumstance are really quite extraordinary and I'm sure that has a lot to do with the fact.\n",
      "[C3] I was wondering if it's to do with the experience.\n",
      "[P1] Yes <C3 you're a> exactly.\n",
      "[C3] You're a mother of young kids.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[C3] So's my daughter but her eldest's nine but she works with children and often with children who are abused. So I wonder if that has a perspective in the in her um appraisal of the <P1 mm> <inaudible> too.\n",
      "[P1] Liz I think the only way to to work that one is for you to read it.\n",
      "[C3] Oh yes.\n",
      "[P1] Okay.\n",
      "[C3] <laughs> Thanks Lynne.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you <C3 bye> for your call. It's half past two and we're talking about The Lovely Bones which is our book club book for March by Alice Sebold Jurate Sasnaitis is with us too from Greville Street bookstore. I suppose this half and half thing <P2 mhm> is uh came up over and over for me it was half a a murder mystery <,> uh exploration of grief half and half it seemed to me half of it was in a pretty authentic to me at least sounding fourteen year old voice and then towards the end it becomes all very omniscient and she's terribly wise and she's staring down from heaven and everybody's being terribly accepting and that kind of jarred. And it's h half some really superb as I was talking about with you and Liz insightful reflections on grief and then this sort of magic realism little <P2 yes> excursions every <P2 yes> now and again. And I think mm dunno about that.\n",
      "[P2] Yeah. It's I think with that sort of writing <,> you either go with the flow or you don't really <P1 yes>. Because if you're going to actually try and figure out like when I was <,> when with preconception as I was rereading the book I was taking notes originally and say for example once again about this character Ruth who's a psychic I was taking these notes that were like oh why is the artist and poet always the loony one <P1 laughs>. Y'know why is it that this person has to hold y'know the sort of loony aspects like sh one she's a lesbian two she's kind of psychic and a bit loopy three she runs around dressed like a goth y'know she she's sort of like the only non-middle class if she's the out <P1 unorthodox character> she's the obvious outcast <P1 yes>. And she also of course is the recipient at the end of a very crucial moment in Susie's development in heaven and on earth but we're not allowed to say 'cos it would spoil everything. Um it's like yes I agree I think those things are really irritating <P1 mm> <,> but <,> as I was reading it this time I found not quite as irritating as the first time and I thought oh it's actually very interesting this person does actually hold ap a s a sort of special place in the book as well because she is kind of a link <P1 yes> and she does actually step outside normal society and have a look at what's really going on <P1 I>. Whereas everyone else is kind of like in it.\n",
      "[P1] Yes living it in the moment <P2 yeah> she's the observer <P2 yeah> that's that's that is true I would have liked to have known more about Ruth I found that a bit tantalising that we sort of get occasional moments of her l living in <P2 yes> New York in a cupboard and <laughs> and working as a waitress. Twenty-seven to three Cathy hi.\n",
      "[P1] That's you.\n",
      "[C4] Look I've just read The Lovely Bones and <,> I do think Alice Sebold has portrayed the effect of a child murder <P1 mm> on a family very well that part of the book I liked but most of her writing irritated me I didn't like it. I certainly don't agree with that um mother of the paediatrician it's certainly not my favourite book <P1 laughs>. Because um the treatment of Mr Harvey like your Jurate has just said I find that too unreal the the lack of wanting to find Mr Harvey and to and to see him caught and dealt with <,> that's too nice Susie's too nice in the way she watches Mr Harvey from heaven and uh it's just not real enough in my w <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] You think she'd be angry.\n",
      "[C4] I think that most people would feel angry.\n",
      "[P1] Absolutely.\n",
      "[C4] <inaudible> when you know about <,> the other serial murders that he's done <P1 yes> and whether it's the fact that you're in America and you can't trace somebody interstate or whatever th that's nothing is put into that <P1 mm> it's almost as if <,> uh uh I just found that very lacking and I slowed down in the middle of the book.\n",
      "[P1] I am exactly with you Cathy 'cos that that had bothered me and I wanted that plotline to continue and I couldn't I found it really frustrating that the <C4 inaudible> search for Mr Harvey just stalled.\n",
      "[C4] And when he does die in last page virtually um it although a previous caller said that they thought it was a a good ending but I didn't think it was good enough <P1 and P2 laugh> really.\n",
      "[P2] That's yes <,> that's interesting.\n",
      "[P1] I d I don't think it would be out of turn to say that um finally w we do get a slight sort of epilogue to Mr Harvey he's been out of the plot in all but very occasional and uh passing mentions for most of the second half of the book and then he suddenly gets dispatched <C4 yes> in the last page or so.\n",
      "[C4] I I I was throughout the book wanted to follow up and find him <P1 mm> because I was feeling outraged and when we did this book in our book club um I heard that Alice Sebold herself had been raped.\n",
      "[P1] That's right yes.\n",
      "[C4] Uf and she s wrote it uh stopped her biography which was called Lucky and then wrote this book and then went back to Lucky or the other way round either way um I see that her experiences have come out in the rape of Susie.\n",
      "[P1] Sure.\n",
      "[C4] But because Alice wasn't murdered um her fantasy is not is not good enough in my books and I don't like the way she sort of tidies it all up at the end <P2 mm> <P1 mm> and that's too too sweet and sh.\n",
      "[P1] Bit too neat.\n",
      "[P2] Yes.\n",
      "[C4] She doesn't stay in heaven looking down in a way she enters people's bodies as if she's uh I mean apart from Ruth she actually goes into her mother's feelings and her father's feelings and the <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] She does watch people's thoughts yeah.\n",
      "[C4] <inaudible> was fantastic. I really was moved I was really feeling sad at the time when mother leaves Abigail leaves <P1 yes>. And I didn't approve of that <,> safe to say I think the facts just um the effect on the children from the paediatrician's point of view that previous caller <P1 laughs> would be terrible <P1 laughs> to have a mother leave for eight years.\n",
      "[P1] Cathy thank you very much for all of that because um there's lots of food for thought in there. Kitty's in Carnegie hi Kitty.\n",
      "[P1] I'm well you liked it.\n",
      "[C5] I did I loved it very much <P1 good> yeah I I'm I'm interested I I actually read it last year on a plane on the way to Paris to um meet up with my husband who was on a conference and it was delightful 'cos I had about <,> ten solid hours to just enjoy it without interruptions from my three young children so it was just great um.\n",
      "[P1] That is true <C5 heaven> heaven yes <P2 yes> <P1 and P2 laugh> that's what your heaven would look like Kitty.\n",
      "[C5] Absolutely and um <P1 time> the one thing I want to say is that um I don't know so much that it was important that this murderer was apprehended and punished and so we could all feel better and sleep better at night I think none of that would have brought Susie back um and I think it was actually quite clever that Alice departed from that avenue and started to look more at the characters and the the loss and the sorrow and all of that <P1 mm>. Um I don't think it needed to be all happily stitched up in uh in another way um depends on one's focus I g.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah fair enough.\n",
      "[C5] Um but I I thought it was delightful. Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you for Kitty I suppose I d I just got captivated in the search and the the <P2 yes> forensics of <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] Oh <,> we should have read a different book.\n",
      "[P1] I know I know Bullia hi.\n",
      "[P1] That's okay.\n",
      "[C6] Uh a friend lent me the book a couple of months ago and at first I wasn't very keen on reading it. Once I'd started however I I found it a very interesting concept and a gripping story and I finished it within a couple of days. But one basic vital part the particular bones that were supposedly recovered <,> seemed totally unrealistic to me and that sort of irritated me all through the book because the elbow <P1 mm> is a junction of y'know some long bones it's not like say a foot or a hand or something that might be a separate thing in itself so had the murderer cut off the forearm and the upper arm first <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Mm I I think that's what happened.\n",
      "[C6] <inaudible> are the bones joined by ligaments or what <P1 mm>. Which seems totally unrealistic and improbable <P1 and P2 laugh> and that basic improbability of the particular bones that she c says were found.\n",
      "[P1] Yes fair enough.\n",
      "[C6] Was a flaw that irritated me <P1 yes> all through the book.\n",
      "[P1] Uh and it would be difficult to get away from that irritation once you'd <P2 that's the trouble isn't it> set upon it <P2 yes> mm. Good point thank you for that The Lovely Bones as they're described on the y'know in the title actually refers to a little passage that comes up late in the book where she describes uh in fact I'll read it for you.\n",
      "[P2] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Which I thought was naff.\n",
      "[P2] Yes I can see you thought that <P2 and P2 laugh>. Look oh I'm so prepared to go with it in a way I just utterly think it's a feelgood novel despite the grim aspects of it. It is definitely meant to send a positive message. Um we can overcome our grief possibilities are there if we have desire we don't have to give up our memories of the beloved we can hold them to us forever life goes on. I mean it's very nice <P1 mm> I think actually like the first time I read it it was quite soon after my grandmother had died and that's when I found that I was very angry with that book because of course it's not that easy really you know and <,> so.\n",
      "[P1] And you do get a sense of that I mean the characters go through all sorts of grief.\n",
      "[P2] They do <P1 as> I think <P1 one of> they do.\n",
      "[P1] One of our callers pointed out Abigail the mother disappears she <,> goes to the other side of the country and works in a winery and.\n",
      "[P2] Which sounded quite fun <laughs> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] The marriage breaks down and she has an affair and all sorts of y'know <P2 yeah> developments and Buckley I really liked taking your calls on The Lovely Bones for this month's book club Juliet in Clayton thank you for being patient.\n",
      "[P1] You loved it.\n",
      "[C7] I did um I read it about a year ago so I sorta I don't remember all the details but I just liked the fact that well I I got out of it that it really annoyed me how the family fell apart like I think if I was in Susie's position and I could see how unhappy my family were that'd really angry me like I'd want them to be sad for a start and then sorta get on with their lives and be h be happy like I just I don't see suh that something that they did that they couldn't have helped happened but then that wrecked their lives as well. And obvious and her brothers as well <P1 mm>. That sorta just really I think I got that out of it so <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] But did it it read <,> believably that that sort of family breakdown.\n",
      "[C7] Well yeah I think that <,> I think that really could happen to someone's <P1 yes> family that if that happened it'd just be terrible.\n",
      "[P1] Split yeah.\n",
      "[C7] Y'know they needed to sort of get over it in a way <P1 mm> and and get on with their lives because they couldn't change it and then not it wasn't gunna bring her back so.\n",
      "[P1] But I suppose the fact that they they can't have a funeral really they have a um a commemorative ceremony but there's <C7 yeah> no body found so it's it's actually really difficult for them <C7 yeah> in lots of ways to deal with the death and disappearance. Like for so long I think <P2 yes> in fact they don't if she they're hoping against hope that she <C7 isn't dead yeah> isn't dead.\n",
      "[C7] I guess that'd be really hard I just I just know if I was in her position I'd just really I'd just want my family to be happy and just sor of y'know go on with things <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] Gee I think I'd want my family to be really unhappy for a really <P1 laughs> for a really long time.\n",
      "[C7] Oh no.\n",
      "[P2] No really like I'd wanna be really missed and I'd want people to have a really hard time <laughs>.\n",
      "[C7] Oh no you wouldn't <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] Ah I dunno <P1 and P2 laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] Oh Juliet you're a very generous soul obviously <P2 mm> thank you for that. Now that that raises a very interesting point and and I think that's that's uh a subtext in the book is <,> that Susie as a fourteen year old does want to be missed and she is <P2 yes> and she struggles too with letting go of her own family and <P2 yeah> sort of having to peer over them all the time to make sure that she's being remembered.\n",
      "[P2] And never to grow up <P1 mm> as well so those strange sort of watching and not being able to participate I mean <P1 mm> quite ghastly really if you think about it.\n",
      "[P1] Terribly frustrating nine-four-one-four-one-seven-seven-four or one-eight-hundred-oh-double-three-eight-hundred if you'd like to talk about The Lovely Bones. Susie Salmon dies and goes to heaven and then watches as all the consequences fall out. Melanie's in Brunswick hi.\n",
      "[P1] Very well.\n",
      "[C8] Good um I loved the book I'll just start with that but I must admit I was quite um choosy in who I recommended it too <P1 ah> seeing that I was a single female no children and I could remove <P1 oh okay> myself from the story and from the family but I didn't recommend it to my mother. I did remec I didn't recommend it to a friend who had children I thought uh y you might not be able to remove yourself from that situation.\n",
      "[P1] Mm that's very sensitive of you Melanie.\n",
      "[C8] <inaudible> <laughs> my thought for the day yeah <P1 laughs> no yeah I just ih ih like I usually recommend something but this I thought no I yeah <P1 just be careful> I think I had the advantage of of not being involved or not or being able to remove myself from it I suppose.\n",
      "[P1] That's really interesting. So ih do you do that with other books or you just thought <C8 oh look I> to do it with this one.\n",
      "[C8] No actually I do do it with other books actually there's a Jacqueline Mitchard book a Theory of Relativity I think it was about a child that uh lost both parents and there's like a custody battle. And again it was like there's certain people I'm not going to recommend that book to.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[P2] You could work in a bookshop Melanie.\n",
      "[C8] <laughs> I'd love to <P1 and P2 laugh>.\n",
      "[P2] Uh oh.\n",
      "[C8] I'd love to so yeah look I ih it I didn't recommend it to a lotta people no.\n",
      "[P1] But you liked it yourself.\n",
      "[C8] I did like it myself it did have a lotta flaws as you said and but I did enjoy it lots of lots of crime but the beautiful part was when she saw her dog.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[C8] Running with the other dogs I bawled <P1 and P2 laugh>.\n",
      "[P2] I'm a dog person <C8 yeah> <C8 laughs> too.\n",
      "[C8] But yeah I did love it <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Fair enough <C8 thanks very much bye> good on you thanks for that <P2 that's nice> now the dog is a lovely character in the book <P2 yeah> his his name is holiday which is just gorgeous in itself and uh the whole notion I suppose of inventing your own heaven I found really a lovely idea a great concept to work with I'd be really interested in what your idea of heaven is if you'd like to share it even if you haven't read the book if you could define your own heaven what would it be I think for one of our callers it was unlimited time alone so you can read <laughs> without uh interruptions from small people. Jurate what would your heaven look like.\n",
      "[P2] I think someone asked me that a few weeks ago when I was first r rereading the book and I just I really don't know. Isn't that terrible it's like I have no concept at all. I cah I really I we were th talking about that old song before we went on air heaven is place on earth <P1 mm> and I think I'm I'm a bit of an earth girl really <P1 laughs>. I'm a bit of a <P1 and earth girls are easy as they say> y'know if we're gunna get a bit spiritual let's go with the beautiful tropical island the blue seas the golden sands and a beautiful sunset I know it sounds pathetic but really. I love it I love and it's like I think that was in the book as well Susie remembering all those wonderful sensory perceptions the smells that you get even skunk smell she talked about remember and um and the sights and flowers and food and you think yeah it's great it's actually great down here despite everything.\n",
      "[P1] Mm <laughs> Margaret's in Anglesea hello Margaret.\n",
      "[P1] What did you make of it.\n",
      "[C9] Well we read it in our book club here in Anglesea last year or the year before and I could relate to it because in my extended family we've suffered the grief and pain of a child's accidental death <P1 mm> and her sister <,> really um behaved much the way that Susie's sister did she didn't want to <,> um be always worrying about Susie's death and she didn't want to be known as the sister of the missing <P1 yes> girl. And I think it's obvious that parents can fall apart because there's so much recrimination after um and so much remorse <P1 mm> after a child's death.\n",
      "[P1] And guilt even if <C9 and guilt> you've had nothing to do with <C9 mhm> it.\n",
      "[C9] Mhm and I think uh Susie's sister who's name I can't remember.\n",
      "[P1] Lindsay.\n",
      "[C9] What was it <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Lindsay mm.\n",
      "[C9] Lindsay really did behave the way some children obviously do <P1 mm> they want to put it out of their minds and say well this happens and therefore I can't do and couldn't do anything about it.\n",
      "[P1] Yep.\n",
      "[C9] But I really thought it was um a very interesting concept of just as good as anybody else's concept <P1 yes> of heaven.\n",
      "[P1] Yes. What would yours look like Margaret.\n",
      "[C9] Oh heavens oh I dunno <P1 and P2 laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] That's a perfect response.\n",
      "[C9] I would be in a garden oh yes oh heaven <P1 laughs> that's a good response <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] In a garden.\n",
      "[C9] In a garden.\n",
      "[P1] A fragrant garden.\n",
      "[C9] Oh yes.\n",
      "[P1] Good.\n",
      "[C9] Mhm.\n",
      "[P1] I hope you've got one <C9 laughs> in Anglesea.\n",
      "[C9] Well it's very difficult in Anglesea growing gardens by the sea.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah this is true <laughs>. Thank you <C9 but anyway we> for your call.\n",
      "[C9] We really had a good discussion that was a very good discussion at our book club <P1 yes> of that book.\n",
      "[P1] And it's been a really good discussion today. Absolutely we've had a couple of calls from people who've had children die and as you can <P2 oh> imagine this is <,> uh very difficult for for them and they tell it tell us that it is impossible to get over.\n",
      "[P2] Of course.\n",
      "[P1] Anything like this and that it can definitely break up families and I <,> I seem to recall hearing some terrible statistic about people who had had this <P2 mm> happen to them. And the number of of family break-ups I think is <P2 yeah> higher much higher than your average because of the incredible stress it puts on all the individual parties and their dealing with their specific manifestations of grief so <,> thank you to those people who rang to tell us about that and um um best luck best condolences six to three Lisa hi.\n",
      "[P1] Did you like the book.\n",
      "[C10] Um I absolutely loved it I read it um it was actually my husband's Christmas present from my mother and I picked it up 'cos I had nothing else to read and I finished it in about two days.\n",
      "[P1] So your mother gave it to your husband.\n",
      "[C10] Yeah <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] That's an interesting choice.\n",
      "[P2] Mm.\n",
      "[C10] Yeah but um.\n",
      "[P2] Did he read it too.\n",
      "[C10] He did but he didn't read it to for quite some time after me but all my friends lined up in the meantime to read it. And most of them thought it was really really good. Mainly because um like we all think about what it's like when you die or <P1 mm> what happens and I just thought that was quite plausible and really nice <P1 and C10 laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] Very desirable.\n",
      "[C10] Yes ih y'know there's her grandfather 'n'.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[P2] Yes that's a nice <C10 all that stuff> scene.\n",
      "[P1] And the dog.\n",
      "[C10] I thought that was <,> yeah and the dog that's right and yet yeah it all made sense I thought it was really great.\n",
      "[P1] And I love that little moment of tension she has which struck me as as just classic fourteen year old response where her father has had the heart attack and he's hovering between life and death and she can't make up her mind what she wants whether or not she wants him to die and come and be with her <C10 yes> or or to live and stay. So.\n",
      "[C10] At her age I thought she was incredibly mature.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah that <C10 like> that sorta maturity bothered me a bit 'cos I didn't <C10 yeah> think that was all that.\n",
      "[C10] And the only other <P1 believable> thing that bothered me was when she sort of inhabited that girl's body.\n",
      "[P1] Yep.\n",
      "[C10] I thought hang on.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah me too.\n",
      "[P2] Mm <P1 laughs> bit icky I thought <laughs>.\n",
      "[C10] Yeah and I thought I thought that it just lost a little bit of credibility there but yeah uh overall it was fantastic.\n",
      "[P1] Fair enough good on you Lisa thank you for that Robyn joins us from Footscray hi Robyn.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[C11] But the police did couldn't seem to work out who it was.\n",
      "[P1] That's right until he'd pushed off and left the town <C11 yes> and went <C11 and then they never found him anyway> without trace.\n",
      "[C11] And I I y'know I got I got a bit annoyed about that I wanted to be c I wanted him to be caught.\n",
      "[P1] Yes me too.\n",
      "[C11] Yeah <laughs> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] I wanted vengeance.\n",
      "[C11] Pardon.\n",
      "[P1] I wanted some vengeance.\n",
      "[C11] Yes <P1 mm> yes but um it was a really good book yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Good <C11 okay thank you> thanks for your call and we'll go to Mary who joins us from Geelong hi Mary.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[P2] Oh that's I think that's very <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Very powerful.\n",
      "[C12] <inaudible> very I don't think her hah her heaven in the book was a happy place at all it <P1 mm> seemed to have to me a a feeling of greyness. To have.\n",
      "[P1] I think she had to move on from that particular that was an interim <C12 yes that's right> limbo and.\n",

      "[P1] I suspect she would be writing one but there's certainly no news yet as to what that might be or when it might be coming out.\n",
      "[C12] Because often you read a book that you really do love and then you never hear of the writer again I'm thinking of like I Heard the Owl Call My Name which I thought was one of the best books I've ever read but I've never heard that Margaret Craven wrote anything else.\n",
      "[P1] I'd have to find out for you I'm sorry <C12 inaudible> Mary <C12 mm>. Sorry.\n",

      "[P1] Thank you for your call. That's very true that it would be enormously difficult to watch your loved ones <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] Yes I think <P1 and> that was a wonderful <P1 and be happy> sort of observation.\n",
      "[P1] Mm <P2 yes> and I suppose that underscores the whole notion of the book that she did have to go through this point of letting go and for her family to do that too on earth and that makes a lot of sense to me <P2 oh yes>. That that's how it would be.\n"

      "[E1] No um the the biggest predator I would imagine and I d I don't I know of no studies done but n knowing the the way the Australian fauna works in in houses <P1 mm> um I would say the Asian house gecko's biggest predator would be the brown tree snake which is a big gecko feeder <P1 yep>. Um but unfortunately the brown tree snake doesn't seem to be able to exist in the broad the broad sort of um uh really seriously altered habitats like the green tree snake like the brown tree snake out in the leafiest suburbs The Gap Toowong out there toward um <P1 yeah> Brisbane Forest Park areas are Pullinvale uh Brookfield that sort of thing but the green whu the whereas the green tree snake lives all over I don't think the green tree snake bothers much with geckos but to answer Gary's question. There's a study that's been conducted in the Northern Territory which shows that the Asian house gecko has in fact got into the natural bushland areas in the Northern Territory <P1 mm> and and may well be taking over pushing uh native species around. Um no extinctions have been recorded even locally. Here and south of Brisbane the assumption is that they probably won't do that and that they are house dependent because they're essentially a tropical animal and we're <P1 mm> getting out of the tropics <P1 yeah>. We're getting to the margins of y'know beyond the margins of where they would normally live in their own um in their own uh original distribution so it may not be detrimental y'know south of the tropics but it may be north of the tropics and that's a study that's ongoing now in the Northern Territory.\n",
      "[P1] Okay so the the <E1 oh not yet worried about them> the jury is still formally <E1 Well we> out.\n",
      "[E1] We yeah we're not yet worried about them in south-east Queensland or or in the southern part of Queensland anyway probably Townsville south mm.\n",
      "[P1] Okay then let's go the phones Mr <E1 let's do that> d Nattrass at seven minutes past three Graham from Tarragindi's first up hi Graham.\n",
      "[P1] Good good how can we help.\n",
      "[C1] Rick um the ringneck uh mallee ringneck you uh sighted any in Brisbane area at all.\n",
      "[E1] Oh yeah.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah I saw one a couple of weeks ago and I got a hell of a shock 'cos I'd seen them in Western Australia. But uh never here in Brisbane.\n",
      "[E1] You sure it was a mallee ringneck.\n",
      "[C1] Well when I look at <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] What colour was the head.\n",
      "[C1] It was a blacky blue.\n",
      "[E1] Ah no. See the mallee ringneck um the top of the head there I think is more like a uh greeny blue um you the two black headed ringnecks are the port lincoln and the twenty-eight. Now they're commonly seen around Brisbane <C1 oh okay> um because s the whoever was actually cleaning the cage and changing the seed and the water left the door open and the bird went out of the aviary.\n",
      "[C1] Okay because yeah according to Simpson and Day they're not supposed to be here are they.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah well I was I was um involved with NatureSearch for about um ten years in the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and the most often recorded non-native in these parts were the two ringnecks. The twenty-eight and um the port lincoln and they are aviary escapees.\n",
      "[P1] Okay there we go thanks for that Graham on the S M S from Cathy at Mudgeerabah Rick had a tiny bug on the glass sliding door the other night and its bum was glowing. What was it.\n",
      "[E1] A beetle <P1 mhm>. And they're uh known as <,> um fireflies despite the fact that they are beetles. And they have a little system in the tips of the abdomen in segments eight nine and ten I think it is um a battery system and a um u ha gha <laughs> lead crystal display unit and they can actually <P1 laughs> boot it up and electrically they pulse out this um this glow <P1 this light>. And they yep and they signal and it's the um <,> now let's see.\n",
      "[P1] <inaudible> that common. Around that area <E1 wuh uh look>. Or even in Queensland.\n",
      "[E1] They actually are but I tell you what I once wanted to do <,> firefly tours I wanted to actually take <P1 mm> people in the evenings and do a flying fox fly out and then take them fireflies and I was talking to the gurus of beetles at the Queensland Museum to find out whether I could really reliably uh predict so that y'know I could plan the thing. And no even though they're widespread they're very common if you get around instead of watching television if you get around good quality bushland in from spring onwards through <P1 mm> summer <,> uh move around to different spots you know every every week mm spend one night out. Uh just for a few hours after sundown. You will see them at some stage. But where they actually hatch and operate is really up and down it's not very predictable.\n",
      "[P1] Okay good question Cathy from Mudgeerabah <,> uh Len from the Sunshine Coast hi Len.\n",
      "[P1] Hello tell us about your maggie.\n",
      "[C2] Uh got a magpie with a bit of um bit of a problem with one of his legs.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah uh like I'd class it as our ankle and I noticed yesterday he's got a piece of thread which appears to have been looped around it. He's got a horrible limp.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C2] Uh.\n",
      "[P1] Much we <C2 inaudible> can do about that <E1 hih> Nick.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah dih.\n",
      "[C2] Should I try and catch him.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah yeah do you feed him.\n",
      "[C2] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Good on you. Okay now the trick here is very simply what I would do is I would ring the Maroochydore I think it is or the Cotton Tree office of Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and let them know you're doing this because if a neighbour sees you setting a trap for a native bird y'know it can cause all sorts of ructions let them know that you've got a bird with a tangled foot and you're gunna attempt to catch it and free it up which they will only be delighted to hear you say 'cos I know there are lots of these casualties out there and not enough rangers <P1 mm>. And what you simply do is feed it in the one spot for a couple of days and set up a simple drop trap which is a light box six inches deep made out of timber with shade cloth on the top propped up at an angle of forty-five degrees with a stick with a string back from there throw the meat underneath when your target bird goes in give it a tweak <,> c cruh clunk down comes the box on the bird <,> um if you miss the bird.\n",
      "[C2] Try again.\n",
      "[E1] The buh well if you miss <C2 he's gunna be wary> he ih he is gunna be very very wary and you give it away for that day and start again tomorrow. 'Cos I've done all this. Um when you do when the box goes down and your bird is under there immediately throw a blanket over the whole lot suh so put it in the dark and that'll reduce all the stress <C2 yeah> and then the trick is to drag that <C2 coughs> box onto a pi sheet of plywood or something rigid and get the whole thing into the garage because if you lift it up you go in there to catch the bird and it gets out you'll never catch it again well not for a week anyway <P1 mm>. Okay.\n",
      "[C2] True true.\n",
      "[E1] So you can do it it can be done I've done it it's just a matter of patience and once you've got him inside it's a two person job if you've a a assistance somebody to hold beak somebody to put some cotton wall balls into those feet 'cos if they <,> if the claws the bird'll be frightened and if the claw even though it knows you if the claws get into your hands it's a fairly painful experience and then just simply with a razor blade or whatever pull the thread off and immediately let the bird go.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah it appears to be quite swollen too so it may be tightened around <P1 mm> that ankle area.\n",
      "[E1] Okay well if it looks as if there's some sort of permanent damage then bung the bird into a box and whip it round to your local vet and just get the vet to have a look and it may well be that it's going to recover. Um if the damage is permanent there's not gunna be treatment anyway are you with me.\n",
      "[C2] No true <E1 yeah> true.\n",
      "[E1] Okay <P1 okay> and I've seen birds who've lost their feet to these things and they still function <P1 inaudible>.\n",
      "[C2] Ah fair enough.\n",
      "[E1] But but please do catch him and relieve him of that 'cos it's <P1 mm> just so nasty <P1 uh>.\n",
      "[C2] That's okay.\n",
      "[P1] And and Len it uh it's worth noting at this point too that uh the captain of Collingwood the Magpies' Nathan Buckley has a hamstring injury also <C2 ah>. How ironic. How uh <C2 so I gotta get on uh>. So if you could <C2 coughs> put him in a cage and throw a blanket on him for season two-thousand-and-five I'd appreciate that too.\n",
      "[C2] Alright.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you <E1 laughs>.\n",
      "[C2] Now <,> I had a question on butcherbirds.\n",
      "[E1] Wh.\n",
      "[P1] Oh s yes quick <E1 go> butcherbird question go ahead.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah uh we had like a parent bird two say two-thousand-and-four and two-thousand-and-three babies. Then all of a sudden we have another parent bird with say another two two-thousand-and-four babies and another two or three two-thousand-and-three babies. Where would they have come from.\n",
      "[E1] Oh you're observing these butcherbirds in only a tiny wah um o only a tiny patch of where they actually live overall you with me.\n",
      "[C2] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] So unless you were to band all of the are they puh pied butcherbirds.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah the black and white ones.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah. Uh if you were to band them all and then follow them around and get an idea of where their wuh the space that they're all occupying you'll find that it's thirty or forty times the size of your backyard.\n",
      "[C2] Uh we're on acreage yeah <E1 yeah well>. I I was just wondering if they'd started to hand out menus or something that y'know this guy wants <P1 laughs> to give them a good feed.\n",
      "[E1] No no no see if you read up on the um on the life history of butcherbirds they're a bit like kookaburras in that there are youngsters from previous nestings that don't actually get tipped out immediately at the end of the breeding season like a lotta birds do. They stay on and become helpers for following seasons. But what they get up to um y'know all year round for those couple of years that they're with mum and dad <,> uh I don't know but I suspect that they're not totally faithful to the nest site and to the parents they show up when times are good and then they help out when times are good and they're in the process of actually looking to get outta that territory and do their own thing.\n",
      "[P1] Mm Len thank you very much we've just got a few more calls to get to. Six-twelve A B C Brisbane and A B C Local Radio Queensland it's twenty minutes past three Ric Nattrass is with us as he is every Monday after the three o'clock news let's go to Cathy from Tolga Cathy hello.\n",
      "[E1] Beautiful.\n",
      "[C3] He starts calling in the morning that awful squawking call.\n",
      "[E1] Mreeaar {cat/catbird imitation}.\n",
      "[C3] Yeah yeah and but he is replying to himself also with a tweety sort of sound.\n",
      "[E1] Yes they do yeah there's more than that call yep.\n",
      "[C3] Is he just on his own.\n",
      "[E1] I dunno I'm down h <laughs>.\n",
      "[C3] Well we've looked and we can only see him <E1 no> he's making <E1 ih> all the noise.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah it yeah it's it's likely to be it's likely to be a male a young male who's found a new patch and and looks like setting up home <C3 mm> and is it's the greenish one.\n",
      "[C3] It is.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah okay so your yours up there is the spotted catbird if you're on <C3 mm> the Atherton Tableland <C3 yeah> ours down here is the green. Um and those {whistles catbird imitation} w whistle calls and things are all part of the call that you you you rarely hear unless you're up close <C3 right> and what I will tell you <C3 mm> was that this happens in my family and my father in law is the catbird guru <C3 right>. Um they love grapes.\n",
      "[C3] Grapes.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C3] Okay <E1 laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Oh nice to know.\n",
      "[C3] So is he gunna make his little display down there during the season or will he hang around.\n",
      "[P1] They once they go into reproductive mode Cathy they are fiendishly difficult to observe <C3 oh okay> so you're gunna have a lot of fun when he's close to the house and if you put a little tray of grapes out he'll love you. That's when you're gunna see him when it gets all reproductive it gets all private.\n",
      "[C3] Right yeah we hear them in the rainforest when we're walking but very rarely see them so.\n",
      "[E1] Correct yeah.\n",
      "[C3] We're a bit excited about this one.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah <P1 oh excellent> absolutely yeah yeah okay.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Cathy.\n",
      "[C3] Okay thank you.\n",
      "[E1] Pleasure.\n",
      "[C3] Bye.\n",
      "[P1] Margaret from River Hills hello.\n",
      "[E1] Well just put your umbrella over your head <C4 right>. But it's not unusual for crows um y'know the the magpie is famous <,> for b um y'know the disturbed one swooping on people during its breeding season but believe me the it's n by no means exclusive. I've been dusted up by <,> noisy friar-birds because I was feeding a baby koel that they thought was theirs and wanted it back I've been dusted up by spangled drongos pied currawongs grey and black uh grey and pied butcherbirds noisy mynas and the piece de resistance of having your ears ripped off is the peregrine falcon if you get too close <C4 no> to the nesting ledge and it's a bird uh w when you have a really good look at it it's the one you don't want dusting you up.\n",
      "[C4] Good I'll change my walking <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] But look no just just put your umbrella over your head <C4 mm> when the bird swoops stand absolutely stock still <,> and remain where you are because the bird will then say to itself hang on it's supposed to run away. And when it doesn't ih within a couple of days it'll stop the behaviour because what it does is it gets a threat back from you that eh it's supposed to run away it's not running away my god I better stop doing that and that's what they do.\n",
      "[P1] Okay there you go Margaret some words of advice there. Hayden from Townsville hi Hayden.\n",
      "[P1] Good good now tell us about this carpet python.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah well Ric last week I think you were talking about the colourations on carpet pythons and uh I was coming down a hill on a my mountain bike one day and um this is a couple of years ago out behind Townsville in the Mt Stewart Road and I came across a I presume it was a carpet python but it was bright yellow and black. Really distinct markings and I I've never seen one in a book like that and I've I've attended snake identification courses I've never seen anything quite like it but <P1 you were talking about> last week.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah dur he was talking about um you were talking about bright yellow ones last week Ric.\n",
      "[E1] No yeah that was <P1 yeah> a different that was a slightly different f different one um Hayden the the carpet python has occasional individuals which are absolutely outrageously stunning. And in my book Talking Wildlife which um is out now there's a photograph there taken by Paul Grimshaw at Mt Crosby on the outskirts of Brisbane of a carpet python which is very very spectacular and unlike your standard job. That's what you've seen there there are just occasional individuals that are incredibly brilliantly coloured like gold and purple.\n",
      "[C5] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C5] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Yep yep.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah absolutely spec and and like at least I would say three metres long a really big <P1 mm> <E1 oh yeah> solid looking python.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah yeah and also um those really dark colours can be when the carpet python is about to do a shed and when uh after it's just before it milks up um they'll get th the whole outside'll get very very dark and that can change colours as well so they're not the same colour all year round. Yep.\n",
      "[P1] Oh thanks for that Hayden six-twelve A B C Brisbane and A B C Local Radio Queensland twenty-five minutes past three this is Wildlife Talkback. Uh next up Alan from Townsville hi Alan.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C6] Uh could you uh give us any idea there.\n",
      "[E1] I think in that magnificent book um by the uh uh published by the Queensland Museum and it's called Wildlife of Tropical North Queensland <,> which you should be able to get you will be able to get in fact from the museum shop I think there is a branch of the Queensland Museum in Townsville is there not.\n",
      "[C6] Uh there's a museum here Ric I'm not sure.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah have a have a look in the phone book for Queensland Museum in <C6 right yeah> Townsville. Pop in there there is a book called Wildlife of Tropical North Queensland. It has all the gecko species in there.\n",
      "[C6] Oh yes.\n",
      "[E1] Now having said that they're highly variable a lotta the species and pretty difficult to sort out <C6 mm> um if you were to um y'know find a deceased one or something the the only way that you can really be positive about its identification is run through some very complicated keys in a book called um Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia by H G Cogger but also I'm pretty certain that there is a branch of the Queensland Museum up there they will be able to help you with your identifications anyway.\n",
      "[C6] And do they mix uh Ric do they mate.\n",
      "[E1] No no no there are there are set species and there's no hybridisation in the Asian house gecko and ours nor any hybridisation that I know of in our own species <C6 I see> and in the Townsville area there's likely to be around about um eight to ten species I would say roughly we've got about six or eight in in the Brisbane area I'd say you'd have eight to ten um and of those about four or five will be wall climbers.\n",
      "[P1] Okay then now that book you mentioned Reptiles and Amphibians <E1 ah it's> of Australia by whom.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah it uh H G Cogger but that's for the y'know the real nerds <P1 the die hard reptile> oh that's it's a nerd it's a y'know it's a well over <P1 it's a nerd> a hundred dollars and it's <,> and it's a nerdy book and you've gotta go through these very complicated keys. The trick is with geckos is to get Wildlife of of either Greater Brisbane for the southern part or um Tropical North Queensland for the northern part have a look at the pickies and see if you can sort them out from there other than that it's a specialist job actually.\n",
      "[P1] Okay now Sharon from Dalby wants to tell us about her her birds hi Sharon.\n",
      "[E1] P N G yep.\n",
      "[C7] Yep and then this year the two of them arrived back again now um and they come usually with the magpies but what I noticed was that um the female was taking food away one day and I thought oh I wonder if she's taking it to a baby but no she was feeding the male up in the tree and then.\n",
      "[E1] Eh.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah. It was the male and then <E1 is that right wow> ih and then after that the male came down one day and he did the same thing and he was feeding her and I I just thought that was most unusual and um they they come down around about the same time as the maggies and the other day the female the maggies were there and the female <,> sort of threatened one of the maggies and when they when she was she sort of hisses and her neck comes up like a.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah chook.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah mm.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah <P1 mm> and I'd I'd never seen it before and um y'know I thought it was just amazing that they came back to the exact same spot <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] No I could tell you something Sharon that the banded birds that we've observed from the Brisbane area that have been hand raised orphans and banded and then allowed to do their normal migration have plonked back in the very same yard that they took off from and I'm talking <C7 yeah>> twenty perch blocks.\n",
      "[C7] That's amazing.\n",
      "[E1] They have landed in exactly the same spot started calling when they've arrived back <C7 yes> you go out and have a look and there's the band on the leg <C7 that's exactly the>.\n",
      "ABCNE1-raw.txt\n",
      "[P1] Mm good to have you on board. Now Roly.\n",
      "[E1] I was I was listening with pleasure to to Tasmania taking things to W A in the cricket. That's heading in the right direction.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah well we're on top of the table at the moment. We've we had two outright victories so far which is <E1 mhm> a great start although um they've certainly uh got a battle on their hands in this particular match.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah <P1 Mm> but but there is I mean Americans call cricket baseball on valium and just don't understand it.\n",
      "[P1] Nah baseball's pretty slow. I've been to the baseball in America and it's it's not a fast game it can be pretty slow and you might only get three or four runs in the in an <E1 inaudible> entire game so.\n",
      "[E1] Whereas cricket has a certain measured elegance and then you get names like remember John Arlott and <,> and Alan McGilvray and the great commentators of the past uh I think uh allows one to appreciate things over several days which is not the sort of thing that you would find in any other sport nowadays.\n",
      "[P1] No there's certainly uh well al although cricket's losing that a little too but there's <E1 yeah> certainly that gentile um factor that uh that that <E1 mm> comes into play there mm.\n",
      "[E1] Tea and cucumber sandwiches in the tent behind the village hall.\n",
      "[P1] Absolutely lovely <both laugh> don't mind if <E1 okay> I do. Alright have you got a teaser for us.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah you'll like got you a stack of them actually. Some of these are quite easy but they're interesting if you don't happen to know them. What is the link between your salary and salt.\n",
      "[P1] Mm okay salary and salt alright the link <,> mkay m <laughs> mine's worth about a pound of it I think that's <E1 laughs> the link in my case.\n",
      "[E1] Depends on the value of salt which <P1 mhm> actually is part of the story as well.\n",
      "[P1] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] Ah last week someone asked about a Scouse phrase okeone or O K E O N E. Absolutely no trace of that I'm afraid I had drew a complete blank.\n",
      "[P1] Oh that's right O K E uh O N E.\n",
      "[E1] That's right <P1 Yes> and it just didn't come up anywhere. Um on the other hand Jeff wanted to know about having a lend of someone or pulling someone's leg. <P1 mm> To have a lend of someone is recorded from the nineteen-tens uh Jonathan Green has it in the Cassells Dictionary of Slang and it means to treat someone like a fool. Um the pulling someone's leg is a nineteenth century story <,> and there are all sorts of variants. Apparently if you were a pickpocket and you wanted to um to <,> disrupt someone so that you could get at their pocket you might grab them by the leg and bring them down uh y'know alley thieves tripping people up so that they could rifle through their pockets.\n",
      "[P1] Sure.\n",
      "[E1] But this is is plausible it is it is not scientific fact and no one is entirely certain so I'm a I'm afraid I've got a an inconclusive answer there as well but that's how it came about <,> they reckon <P1 inaudible>. I now have a question about tillies.\n",
      "[P1] Tillies.\n",
      "[E1] Mm uh the British in the fifties uh had a the army had a need for some cut down cars that could carry things from A to B so Austin Hillman and Singer there are names from the past for <P1 mm> you um made a sort of heavy duty pickup version of their of their sedans and these were called tillies from utility. Bit unusual because you take the s middle syllable of the word and put ies on the end <,> um but I have reports of tilly being used instead of ute in Australia and there are three pockets of tilly one of them is at Rockhampton Central Queensland second one is on the Darling Downs west of here from about Warwick Allora Dalby over the border down into Lismore <,> and there's another pocket of tillies in Hobart.\n",
      "[P1] Really.\n",
      "[E1] What I want to know is <,> do any of the listeners use tilly or have they used tilly in the past for utility do they still do so and can they give us place and time because this looks like an odd distribution. Certainly ute is winning hands down nowadays <P1 mm> but the tilly has been around in the past.\n",
      "[P1] You wonder how these little pockets emerge don't you I guess uh very strong uh English uh migration population <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Possibly but I n I've got some references to tilly from Dalby in the thirties which is well before the Brits started. So maybe they picked up the term from Australian servicemen who were in Britain <,> and then proceeded to make their tillies <,> uh as while we were chopping off the backs of Holdens 'n' things and making utes.\n",
      "[P1] Could be.\n",
      "[E1] Right golf.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[E1] You a golfer sir.\n",
      "[P1] Ah i ish yes I have played yes I I not regularly but I have yes.\n",
      "[E1] On a scale of one to ten that sounds like about two point seven.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Yes it's <E1 um> about that too. It's more for the <E1 alright> social aspect it's more for the beer afterwards I like what it leads to.\n",
      "[E1] Oh I see <P1 laughs> you're a you're a nineteenth green person.\n",
      "[P1] Oh definitely yes.\n",
      "[E1] Okay well the name golf uh originally and often pronounced in Scottish English gowf G O W F <,> thereï¿½s even a n club in Ayrshire which calls itself a gowfclub G O W F <,> but uh one of the listeners got hold of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews <,> and uh asked them about golf 'n' when it was first ah noted <,> the thereï¿½s a Dutch word <,> cowf C O W F meaning club and so they think that that was where the the name from. In fourteen-fifty-seven James the Second banned golf 'n' football because people weren't doing their archery practice <both laugh> please I like that.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] But some of the words from golf have odd histories. Link was the strip of land between the sea and agricultural land. So I suppose that was something that you could use for sporting purposes without disrupting either the fishermen or the farmers. Uh bogey comes from a mythical amateur golfer who was supposed to bogey things. Par <,> uh French and Latin word for average ah came into use round about eighteen-ninety-one. Birdies eagles and albatrosses. In the US who which took up golf with avidity <,> there was a phrase in the late nineteenth century a bird of a shot meaning a very good one and that's where they got birdie from and once you had one avian representative you also got eagles and albatrosses.\n",
      "[P1] Mm.\n",
      "[E1] A fore <,> is probably from the word forecaddie <,> who was someone who went ahead to mark the lie of the ball where the lord of the manor had uh mishit as it were.\n",
      "[P1] So he would yell <E1 with caddy it's> you would yell fore to the caddy to warn him.\n",
      "[E1] Well that's what happened later. But the forecaddie was someone who went fore <,> and um caddy is from French cadet C A D E T meaning young <,> the younger son joined the army and many caddies were ex army people looking for a job. So the caddy is someone who is younger and went around looking for the lie of the ball or later on carrying the clubs of milord. So golf has has a a a rather interesting and very well focused group of words which uh grew up over the years and uh the Royal and Ancient Club <,> St Andrews is now the home of golf as you know.\n",
      "[P1] Very rich heritage. Barry from Sandy Bay g'day Barry.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah I remember that too <,> um there is a dialectal word sprag I think which means lively young man sort of something like that uh but I haven't heard that for y for a long time. Wh where did you go to school Barry.\n",
      "[C1] In Melbourne\n",
      "[E1] Melbourne okay so did I. So <,> Trevor did they use sprog in <P1 sprog no> New South Wales.\n",
      "[P1] Not in my time no not sproggy no or s uh sprog yes I heard sprogs but not sproggy no.\n",
      "[E1] Okay and to and to sprog was a verb oh you know someone sprogging means they're getti giving birth to.\n",
      "[P1] Oh okay okay.\n",
      "[E1] So yeah thank you for reminding me Barry I'll see if I can find a bit more but the dictionary last time I checked said orig uncert <laughs> which means they don't know where it came from.\n",
      "[P1] Ok Barry <sound effect> thank you for your call <laughs> Barry's gone obviously. Anne from Garden River g'day Anne.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[C2] Uh I was in the Wrens oh a long time ago and if ever we were to go out uh uh to sort of see something special you know just a a small group of us <E1 right> we would get in a tilly van.\n",
      "[E1] Uh it was called a tilly van.\n",
      "[C2] Tilly van yes.\n",
      "[E1] Okay date roughly when.\n",
      "[C2] Oh date um Iï¿½ll have to do some mathematics hang on um forty years ago.\n",
      "[E1] Okay mm minus forty this is interesting and what can you tell us what a tilly van was like.\n",
      "[C2] Well it was just like a small bus really um <E1 oh okay> I think it seats about <,> oh twenty people <E1 mhm> twentyish people maybe thirty but it was like a small bus.\n",
      "[E1] And this was in England.\n",
      "[C2] In England yes.\n",
      "[E1] Mm which part of.\n",
      "[C2] Uh uh <,> w w w what where I was in the navy was in the south.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm okay <C2 inaudible> because sometimes these things are fairly local this sounds as if they've picked up the word tilly from the earlier use in the fifties <,> and then extended it to apply to a particular sort of ah additional type of vehicle like a van.\n",
      "[C2] Mm it was a Naval <E1 yeah> airbase I remember that.\n",
      "[E1] Naval airbase <C2 inaudible>. South Hampton or someplace <laughs>.\n",
      "[C2] <laughs> H M S Gamecock I remember that much but I I just truly can't remember where it was I wasn't really happy at the time um <E1 okay> so memories didn't s sort of cling.\n",
      "[E1] I'll be able to find out about the Gamecock because there's a very nice Royal Navy website which has all of these things on it.\n",
      "[C2] Uhuh well Gamecock <E1 yeah> was the was the ah name of the place and sprog that comes from England I think too because it was like a uh uh um <,> not a very nice name for s for a child you know <E1 mm that's right yeah> a derogatory sort of uh uh title for a child.\n",
      "[E1] Yes we used to use it in Melbourne I I heard it when I was living in New Zealand and <C2 mm> I've also I'm certain heard it in London <C2 Right okay > <P1 mm>. It was s slightly disreputable you know it sort of.\n",
      "[C2] That's right that's right <E1 uh> <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] If there was actually <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] You know someone might be giving birth in an upper-class hospital but they were sprogging away <laughs> <C2 Oh I see> if they had a midwife or something yeah.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you Anne.\n",
      "[C2] Thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Of course you were never referred to as a sprog were you Roly.\n",
      "[E1] Uh probably <both laugh> I was referred to as lots of things.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Sixteen minutes to three on nine-three-six A B C Hobart Trevor Jackson with Roly Sussex this afternoon Lance from West Hobart g'day Lance.\n",
      "[P1] Hello there.\n",
      "[E1] Hello.\n",
      "[C3] Uh Roly I come from a generation where salt was still put into the cellars the s and the little spoons and one of my jobs to get pocket money was once a week I had to roll the ah heavy salt with a glass rolling pin and they added corn flour <E1 ah yes> to it <P1 yes> in those days somebody worked their bloody guts out was called worth their salt which I think <E1 that's right> could be from the old word salarium meaning salary eh.\n",
      "[E1] You got the whole thing.\n",
      "[P1] Nah.\n",
      "[C3] <laughs> <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] With one small little bit left out the Roman soldiers used to be paid in salt <C3 inaudible> and that was <,> that's right 'n' that was where the uh the orig word the word originally came from and salt was a commodity which was very expensive and worthwhile.\n",
      "[C3] Yeah that's why you <E1 un> sat be you sat below or above the salt <E1 that's right> if you were worth the money you were above the salt and uh but I can remember once that uh <,> at the Governor General's residence seeing salt cellar and little s uh I'm sorry uh <E1 mm> uh what's the word cru cruet sets for every <E1 mm> person in front of them so there'd be no ab absolutely no way that anybody feel out of uh according.\n",
      "[E1] Out of place <C3 laughs> because if you were above the salt the salt was in the middle of the table 'n' milord and so were sat on one side and the and the underlings to the other. But you're dead right about salt and it w wasn't I think until the nineteenth century when they found out ways of making salt in large quantities cheaply that it became less valuable than it had been before.\n",
      "[C3] I I I've got this funny idea but we had to earn our X amount per week. It was sixpence to go to the pictures then you had to have your money for your bubblegum and your pence <E1 yes> for the icecream but one of the other things I had to do was to mix up the whiting and do the front stairs.\n",
      "[P1] Oh okay.\n",
      "[E1] Oh yes <C3 quite>. Now that's another <C3 inaudible> another task that has now sinh <C3 inaudible> long since gone.\n",
      "[C3] There's other people who more than likely have better stories <laughs> than that <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Oh no this ih this is good stuff.\n",
      "[C3] Thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] No its great Lance <E1 Thank you reminding> thank you Lance. Thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is the number. Yes young people don't know how good they've got it today Roly do they.\n",
      "[E1] They don't they don't. Trevor I've another one. What is the connection between pollution and malaria.\n",
      "[P1] Pollution and malaria <E1 mhm> okay. Pollution and malaria. That's Roly's second teasier teaser for this afternoon. If you think you know it thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred. Pauline from Kingston hello Pauline.\n",
      "[E1] Okay thank you <C4 so that's> sprog in the navy.\n",
      "[C4] You know navy from <inaudible> they were down the South Coast they were based down at Portsmouth or Plymouth <E1 yeah> mm <,> okay.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you for sprog.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Pauline. No thank you very much <C4 thank you bye>. John John from Mornington hello John.\n",
      "[E1] Oh <,> mm alright we don't have starlings up here. I shall have to do a little bit of work on this one.\n",
      "[C5] Starlings <E1 mm yeah> everywhere except for Western Australia.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah well they may be but not not where I live <C5 inaudible>. Um starling spadger sparrow mm alright thank you f I I've going to have to do a bit of homework on that one.\n",
      "[C5] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Alright John. Thrown a bit of a spanner in Roly's works that's good to see <laughs>.\n",
      "[C5] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you Trevor.\n",
      "[P1] Keep the man on his toes <laughs> thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred for language talkback Alan from Midway Point. G'day Alan.\n",
      "[E1] That's before anopheles was discovered yep you're dead right particularly the swamps of ancient Rome and such places which were apparently very good <,> as uh <,> places where malaria would grow so mal aria is Latin or in Italian actually <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Bad air.\n",
      "[E1] Bad air.\n",
      "[P1] Well done. Thank you Alan.\n",
      "[E1] That was a bit of of medical bad diagnosis.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Thanks Alan thanks for the call. Have you got a another teaser Roly.\n",
      "[E1] Alright what's a link <P1 in a minute or two>. This one is a bit more obscure. The link between typhoid and smoking.\n",
      "[P1] Typhoid and smoking alright.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm.\n",
      "[P1] Okay. This is fun I like this. Thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred <E1 laughs> is the number if you've got uh an inkling of what uh Roly's teaser might be the link between typhoid and smoking.\n",
      "[P1] Trevor Jackson with Roly Sussex this afternoon on nine-three-six A B C Hobart thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is the number. Roly a scholar and a gentleman.\n",
      "[E1] Yes and my thanks to Neil Kurtz from Rose Bay in Tasmania <,> who sent me some very interesting information. Um Burns had it round the other way a gentleman and scholar and his poem The Twa Dogs two dogs <,> Wordsworth in The Prelude had scholars and gentlemen and Partridge in his Dictionary of Catchphrases <,> has this lovely phrase a gentleman and a scholar and a fine judge of whiskey. <P1 laughs> A good man. <P1 indeed> And C C Colton a man I didn't know about in a um poem called Lacon uh has the phrase a gentleman by nature and a scholar by education <,> and one of my listeners has sent me a a lovely story from Punch the alas defunct magazine a uh officer turns up at a hotel <,> announces himself at the reception desk and the receptionist rings up to a young lady <,> and says there's a scholar and a gentleman for you madam and she says send them both up.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Fair enough. Colin from Lauderdale. G'day Colin.\n",
      "[E1] Okay that one I didn't know and this was the R A F.\n",
      "[C7] The R A F yes National Service <E1 inaudible> Britain late fifties.\n",
      "[P1] Seems to be very common the armed services doesn't it.\n",
      "[C7] But n yeah but nev.\n",
      "[E1] It does indeed.\n",
      "[C7] I never I've never heard sproggy. It was always a sprog a new sprog.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah the sproggy bit mm unless it means starling which I'm going to have to find out about. Um do you happen to know whether it was used in the other services.\n",
      "[C7] No I don't <,> no <E1 mm> I can only comment it from my own experience which was Royal Airforce Britain <E1 we're> late fifties.\n",
      "[E1] Gradually getting a picture of it though thank you <C7 inaudible> very much.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you Colin.\n",
      "[C7] Good-o <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Okay.\n",
      "[C7] Bye.\n",
      "[P1] Now Roly you want to talk about hyphens today as well.\n",
      "[E1] I'm I'm absolutely burning up to talk about hyphens <P1 laughs> yes <P1 okay>. Um a <P1 off you go> a listener in South Australia said look we've got antemeridian which is one word but post-meridian which is hyphenated and you've got anti-establishment which is hyphenated but antidisestablishmentarianism which is not. What's going on. Ah in times like this turn to Pam Peters's lovely book Australian English Style Guide <,> and what follows is is largely taken from her. There are three levels of combining words you can have them totally separate you can have them hyphenated or they can be joined. And on the whole the Americans join things and on the whole the Brits tend not to and half-way house is a hyphen. Generally speaking if a word oh sorry if two words come together and create something which now has a new meaning like runoff as of rain <,> then it will be written as one word. But lots of others <,> are hyphenated and the question is when. Well first of all if you get to the end of a line and there's no room for what you want to write you do a hyphen <,> and the rule is generally break before one consonant between two and after <,> one and before the next two I think that's right. I have to think about that one. Occasionally <,> you need a hyphen to separate meanings like re-cover and recover <,> right you wouldn't want to get those two mixed up so the hyphen actually emphasises that the re is to be added to the meaning of cover <P1 yes> rather than to form a new word recover which is now a meaning on its own. You can have prefixes and roots like counter-terrorist hyphenated you can have root plus root doorjamb and you can have roots joined up which don't actually stand on their own like agri doesn't stand by its own but agribusiness one word <,> is okay. There are a couple of odd things um <,> if you've got a word which includes some different typography in other words something like um F B T for Fringe Benefit Tax uh then if you are anti-F B T you'd be anti hyphen F B T you wouldn't <P1 mm> want to mix lower case and upper case in the one word.\n",
      "[P1] Mm\n",
      "[E1] But then you got co and ex. If the C O words are old like coexist they're one word. If they're newer like co-author they tend to be hyphenated. This is getting worse 'n' worse 'n' worse. And if you have a verb like to babysit that tends to be one word <,> but sometimes hyphenated but if you've got a babysitter that's almost always one word. Not baby hyphen sitter but babysitter.\n",
      "[P1] So do you think the newer words uh have the hyphens simply because or or <E1 yeah> the older words don't simply because we've been writing them so long we get a little bit lazy and we just end up joining them.\n",
      "[E1] It's not so much lazy as I think they've established themselves as having a particular meaning which is not just the joining of the two bits <,> but for example amoral is not just non moral but it suggests some certain sorts of behaviour which cluster together <,> and so amoral is taken as a piece and you don't think of it as being compositional or made up of two separate bits <P1 mm>. And uh whereas uh more recent words which have been coined and are sitting there like gift-wrap for example <,> that's fairly recent and so that is hyphenated <,> barefoot has been around for a long long time and so that's one word <P1 yes> um open-door policy open hyphen door policy I would've thought um and sometimes if you get a phrase which is used always in the same way like an equal opportunity employer you just write the words separately. So there are a <,> there are some regularities for example editor-in-chief that would always be hyphens mother-in-law is always hyphens but notice that the modifiers the in chief and in law actually follow. So I do recommend either the A G P S Style Guide that's the Australian Government Publishing Service <,> or Pam Peters uh on the um uh Australian English Usage or if you like dear old Fowler. Now they all talk about this and the answer to the question is no when not when do I use a hyphen is um there are some cases which are two le two words there are some which are one word 'n' there are lots which are vacillating in between with hyphens.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Indeed.\n",
      "[E1] Sorry to be indecisive <P1 laughs>. In hyphen decisive.\n",
      "[P1] Roger from Lindisfarne. G'day Roger.\n",
      "[E1] New recruits yes.\n",
      "[C8] Yep so {break} that <E1 thank you> helps to pad out the picture for you.\n",
      "[E1] Indeed so we now have army and airforce navy people please pick up the phone.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Okay.\n",
      "[C8] Okay goodbye.\n",
      "[P1] Alright thank you Roger <E1 thank you> yes and uh Carol's just given me a message uh Roly that someone else from the armed forces has uh phoned the A B C switchboard ah from Portsmouth to say that yeah <E1 oh> sprog same thing. Leon from uh.\n",
      "[E1] Portsmouth England or Portsmouth Tasmania.\n",
      "[P1] <inaudible> Portsmouth Tasmania <both laugh> <E1 okay>. England <laughs>. There you go. I've just got a nod of the head there. Okay Leon good afternoon. Leon who's not from Portsmouth hello Leon are you there. No we don't seem to have Leon Carol you might try 'n' see if we can get Leon back. Uh yes it's gunna be very interesting you've started something with sprog now haven't you.\n",
      "[E1] Well yes it wasn't entirely me either. And off we go. Uh tillies people. Surely someone must use tilly in Tasmania.\n",
      "[P1] Yes um we haven't had uh we only had uh from the the lady who was in stationed in in England at the time <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] That's right and forget not typhoid and smoke <P1 mm> I want to know about the link.\n",
      "[P1] You're a you're absolutely certain that tillies was used here.\n",
      "[E1] Oh yeah <P1 mm> and uh I I listeners being absolutely certain and collaborating each sh corroborating each other uh are these three little pockets Rockhampton the Darling Downs and Hobart.\n",
      "[P1] Mm okay thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number you wanna be quick 'cos we've only got a little bit of time left on the program this afternoon uh any more homework Roly.\n",
      "[E1] Uh not really I think the there there oh yeah I've got a couple of bits. Um Osheania {Oceania} Oseania {Oceania} Osheana {Oceania} um there's a word foliage which tends to come out as folage {foliage} <P1 laughs> not with Peter Cundell but then he's A B C and Tasmania so he'd get it right but Oseania {Oceania} has been coming out as Oseana this is the soccer stuff recently. Um yeah it seems to be hard to say and there are a few other <,> other examples of it as well. Ah another little bit that I picked up the the term master and slave which is used in computer um speak for a particular type of typology of networks is now no longer kosher in Tasmania. Uh the words uh have unfortunate associations and the computer geeks have gotta find something else.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Fair enough. Jim from Glenorchy.\n",
      "[E1] Ah yeah that's a different Tilley that's a a maker's name for those kerosene pressure lanterns.\n",
      "[C9] Oh right yeah yeah <E1 yeah> oh well yeah I just thought they might've been you know like in the old days where you went <,> out on manoeuvres in the in the little ute or <E1 mm> whatever the tilly ute and used a Tilley lamp.\n",
      "[E1] Uh right uh it's a good idea but I'm afraid <C9 inaudible> in this case <laughs> it doesn't work.\n",
      "[C9] I'm off the track.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Alright Jim.\n",
      "[E1] Rightio <C9 eh>.\n",
      "[P1] Yes <inaudible> <C9 toodle-loo>.\n",
      "[P1] Okay <laughs> uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number. Tilly well no takers on that perhaps by the program next week we might hear from that. Uh if you've missed any s any particular aspect of the program today W W W dot A B C dot net dot A U uh slash uh Hobart tt and uh just check the links through the afternoon program and you will find uh today's language talkback session. Now Roly you do have a last word for us today before we go.\n",
      "[E1] Yes there was a piece in the Brisbane Courier Mail which said the emotion over the decision that's giving Sachin Tendulkar out will louden the call for further technology <P1 mm>. And one of the listeners has sent me a poem.\n",
      "[E1] Thanks to Ray Kelly {break}.\n",
      "[P1] {break} <laughs>. And thanks y thank you Roly Sussex.\n",
      "ABCNE2-raw.txt\n",
      "[P1] Very well thank you how are you.\n",
      "[E1] Good I'm good thank you.\n",
      "[P1] You're looking very festive in a very uh well it's a Hawaiian shirt but it's red it's it's almost Christmassy isn't it.\n",
      "[E1] Red and white that's right it's <P1 inaudible> that time of the year isn't it.\n",
      "[P1] I like that yes <E1 mm>. Yes now uh what sort of flower that's the hibiscus uh it would be have uh being a real Hawaiian shirt wouldn't it.\n",
      "[E1] Absolutely.\n",
      "[P1] Okay yes. Glad you can identify the flower that's on your shirt.\n",
      "[E1] I'm glad you can <P1 laughs>. Shows you're listening to the program <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Not not not a great flower to try and grow in Tassie though.\n",
      "[E1] Uh there are a few of them growing around <P1 yeah>. In pockets in warm pockets yes absolutely. Um.\n",
      "[P1] What up in the north-east somewhere.\n",
      "[E1] No my word no no not uh in Hobart they're growing very well <P1 oh okay>. They'll grow on the east coast but they'll grow in Hobart as well uh there are a few of them around Newtown <P1 mm> uh a few around Lenah Valley so you do <P1 mm> see them around.\n",
      "[P1] Okay <E1 mm yep> alright but the <E1 some are flowering> but prefer but prefer a warmer climate.\n",
      "[E1] They would prefer a warm climate yes <P1 mm okay> but uh in a sun trap they're a great little plant to grow.\n",
      "[P1] Alright well thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is the number at this time of the year people taking breaks getting out and about and plenty of time to get out in the garden so I wouldn't be surprised if we have quite a few questions from our listeners this afternoon Graham from Hobart first cab off the rank how are you Graham.\n",
      "[E1] Yes yes.\n",
      "[C1] Uh well I've got ten plants growing.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C1] They're about ten centimetres high but the stems are very thin do I do anything with them or is that what they <,> they do they grow on a vine.\n",
      "[E1] They'll grow on a vine Graham <C1 mm> so look to promote the the the stem growth <C1 mm> and uh help them thicken up pinch the the side laterals outta them. Until they get to a reasonable height <C1 right> and l then let them grow and expand uh and then they'll start fruiting.\n",
      "[C1] Oh very good. Uh another thing y'know the gentleman last week that couldn't get any apricots on his tree.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Yes yes up at Swansea way wasn't he.\n",
      "[E1] No he was up in the north.\n",
      "[C1] I had uh I have got two tamarillo trees one <,> exactly the same size and planted the same day. One has massive fruit the other one didn't have any <E1 mm>. So I fed it about four handfuls of um sulfate of potash <E1 yeah> every week for about four or five weeks. The leaves started to turn brown on the edges so I stopped. All those leaves fell off and then the new leaves and fruit there's m masses on the tree.\n",
      "[E1] Good. Well that's good.\n",
      "[C1] So it's it's massive doses of the uh.\n",
      "[E1] Of the sulfate of potash.\n",
      "[C1] Potash.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah yeah <C1 okay> thanks Graham.\n",
      "[C1] No problem.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Graham thank you for your call Patricia from Montrose good afternoon Patricia.\n",
      "[E1] I reckon Patricia that your passionfruit is a little bit hungry <C2 oh right>. Okay is it a little bit is it a little bit pale and yellowy in the leaves.\n",
      "[C2] I've cut the yucky leaves off <E1 right> and I'm left with uh rather nice um um fresh green leaves.\n",
      "[E1] Fresh green leaves good okay <C2 yes> I reckon it's a little bit hungry. Now <C2 right> um Nelly Kelly passionfruit are really heavy feeders and by that I mean you're going to need to feed them more than once a year you're gunna need to feed them at least two or three times a year and the best thing to use on them is either super phosphate right <C2 yes> or a complete fertiliser <C2 I see>. Now if you give your Nelly Kelly passionfruit at least two or three good handfuls of that and water it in throughout the year you'll not only get lush growth and have very green leaves uh but you'll also tt get an abundance of fruit coming through.\n",
      "[C2] I see <E1 right> so what you're saying is that the passionfruit has not been fed enough <E1 that's right> enough to enable it to make fruit is that what you're saying.\n",
      "[E1] That's right because uh 'cos when you th you picture your passionfruit in your mind you've got these g really big <C2 yes> glossy green leaves with <C2 yes> lovely long leaders and tendrils. Now <C2 yes> it takes uh a lot of uh energy to maintain those big green leaves to begin with <C2 yes> and it also takes a lot of energy to grow with big green leaves <C2 yes>. Okay <C2 yes> and that's why it needs a good feed <C2 yes> and regularly <C2 yes>.\n",
      "[P1] Patricia have you got much fruit at all over the six years. Nothing at all really.\n",
      "[C2] None.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Okay it's just struggled all the way.\n",
      "[C2] My first fruit and I'm sitting down there guarding it <P1 and E1 laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] Bet you are day and night <C2 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Well then make sure you're the only one that enjoys <P1 laughs> that fruit Patricia.\n",
      "[C2] I will don't worry about that <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Good on you.\n",
      "[C2] Thank you.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs> Thanks Patricia <C2 bye>. Jeez talk about hard fruits for your labour. Uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number l lot of listeners phone in to say that they've got Nelly Kellys uh uh generally speaking Greg are they <,> more easy to grow in the passionfruit fam.\n",
      "[E1] Um it's not so much that they're easy to grow Trevor it's that they're such a great fruit <P1 mm>. They're a lovely fruit to eat they're the definitely the pick of the passionfruits.\n",
      "[P1] They're one of the sweeter fruit are they.\n",
      "[E1] They're one of the sweeter ones but they've also one of these plants or fruiting plants has been around since the year dot. They're like a moor puhp morg puh puh muh <P1 laughs> puh like a Moor Park apricot <P1 yeah> or uh a Meyer lemon. They're they're proven winners they're reliable uh and people just keep coming back to them <P1 mm>. And every so often you get a new variety that comes in and and a few people test them and they come back and they say nah it's not as good as the Nelly Kelly <P1 Nelly Kelly okay>. You can't beat it.\n",
      "[P1] Alright <laughs>. Thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number and I should uh mention too that we're gunna offer up a copy of the the latest issue of the A B C Limelight magazine. So to our best caller this afternoon and Greg will be keeping a close ear on you uh we will offer a copy of uh the A B C's Limelight magazine some good reading over summer and indeed uh when we're looking for some decent entertainment on the radio and the box you'll find it there 'n' some good stories too. John from Newtown g'day John.\n",
      "[P1] Yes John hello.\n",
      "[C3] Oh sorry old mate I didn't realise you were so quick.\n",
      "[P1] Oh that's alright John.\n",
      "[C3] Um good afternoon to you both number one I've guh old lady across the road my dear old mate gave me some great big fat juicy bulbs the name of which I can only remember she called them naked ladies.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah yeah.\n",
      "[C3] She said that they wouldn't um flower the first year but I've <E1 that's right> planted them out in sort of good compost and they burst out in loads and loads of green leaves but no flower <E1 mm> now this year will they flower.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah they will now uh a bulb like a naked lady likes being rather pot-bound or root-bound <C3 ah> and it's bound up so if you put it in the pot John <C3 yeah> it'll probably flower next year <P1 yes> but if you put it in the ground it'll probably flower the year after.\n",
      "[C3] Gotcha <E1 ih> so do these ones I've I've got some in a pot which didn't flower last year <E1 yeah> but they're I put a hell of a lot in so they must be getting pretty pushed together.\n",
      "[E1] Yih that's w that's what you want you want those roots to really mat down together and then it'll start to flower.\n",
      "[C3] So these ones should <,> come up with a bit of a flower this year.\n",
      "[E1] That's right and then around about say every ooh oh five or six years you can take to them with a spade <C3 yep> and and and thin them out a little bit <C3 yep> and then they'll start flowering again.\n",
      "[C3] May I ask you the proper name it always sounds a bit sort of rude to.\n",
      "[P1] Saying naked lady bulbs <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] There's nothing wrong with saying naked lady bulbs they've been aruh they're another one. They've been around for so long. People know them as naked ladies or nerines.\n",
      "[C3] Wuh my old prim and proper mate unfortunately of course she died lih last year <E1 mm> she was eighty-six and <E1 mm> she called her that I thought well if a lady like her can call a.\n",
      "[P1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Naked ladies yeah. They're called nerines <C3 nerines> John nerines.\n",
      "[C3] Good man thanks for your help.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you John <E1 thanks>. Uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred for Gardening Talkback on Nine-Three-Six A B C Hobart Iris from Sandy Bay hello Iris.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C4] They won't flower um. They have all the foliage <E1 mm> both um the flag ones in particular have um yep beautiful big wide tall <E1 leaves yeah> leaves but nothing happens. I expose the rhizomes to the sun. I fertilise them.\n",
      "[E1] What with Iris.\n",
      "[C4] Um the pellet stuff.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C4] Yun in <E1 yep> that outdoor <E1 yep> stuff and uh occasionally some seeh uh uh seaweed g uh liquid <E1 mhm> Aquasol or something and um <,> uh I've got about thirty and I got about three <E1 mm>. And I didn't <E1 how> get any Dutch irises.\n",
      "[E1] H h how long have you had the flag irises in for.\n",
      "[C4] A long long time.\n",
      "[E1] Alright well I think you're being too kind to them.\n",
      "[P1] Ooh.\n",
      "[C4] Well I didn't think I mean they grow wild in in the country don't they.\n",
      "[E1] That's exactly why I think you're being too kind to them. You are feeding them too much and they're sitting back there and they're very complacent they're happy 'n' they're getting fat 'n' they don't have to they don't have to <P1 flower no> flower for you <P1 laughs> <C4 laughs>. So they're not going to.\n",
      "[C4] I wondered if I I should dig them up and put them in a new bed.\n",
      "[E1] Absolutely not no leave them where they are but don't fl uh feed them for at least another two or three years <E1 right>. Alright it sounds like you're over feeding them and they're they're just in a in a puchih position where they just they don't have to do anything.\n",
      "[C4] We are in clay.\n",
      "[E1] Doesn't matter.\n",
      "[C4] Oh well that's <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Doesn't matter.\n",
      "[C4] In y'know as I said in the country you see them absolutely neglected 'n' they <E1 uh> flower beautifully.\n",
      "[E1] Exactly and that's exactly why we don't want you to feed them anymore.\n",
      "[C4] Right.\n",
      "[E1] And that kinda goes against the grain doesn't it because you listen to me all the time 'n' I'm saying feed it <P1 laughs> feed it feed it but in this case don't.\n",
      "[P1] Starve it.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C4] Well it has this lush growth but nothing else.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah and that's why. You're feeding them too much <C4 right>. Okay now as far as your other irises go are you doing the same thing <C4 wuh>. Are you feeding them a lot.\n",
      "[C4] Uh wuh yes uh the whole garden geh <E1 mm> I d I duh don't put much sheep manure or stuff about I find that's <E1 right> hard to get 'n' <E1 yeah> uh it's easier to buy something <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Okay well look for the next two years or so uh avoid feeding the iris beds <C4 right> right completely and let them dry out a little bit as well.\n",
      "[C4] Yes well they are um and have been f kept fairly damp.\n",
      "[E1] Right yeah well you want them to dry out a little bit. You wanna stress them a bit because that's how you're gunna make them flower <C4 right>. They're one of these plants that really reacts well to stress <C4 oh good>. So the more stress you f you give them by not feeding them very often and not watering them too much the better the flowers and the prolonged flowering season.\n",
      "[C4] Oh I'll <E1 will occur> just ignore them then.\n",
      "[E1] Yes <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Mm and Iris don't you get too stressed going hard on your irises okay.\n",
      "[C4] <laughs> Thank you very much <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Thanks Iris bye-bye.\n",
      "[P1] Have a nice Christmas <laughs>. Seventeen minutes to three.\n",
      "[P1] Trevor Jackson and Greg Kerrin this afternoon for Gardening Talkback sixteen minutes to three good afternoon Peter how are you.\n",
      "[P1] What can we do for you Pete.\n",
      "[C5] Uh Greg regarding my walnut tree that I spoke to you about eighteen months ago I mentioned to your brother when he was last in I think it was week before last <E1 yes> I dunno when he passed on the message or not that uh you told me to take to it with a broom handle <E1 yeah>. Which I did <E1 mm>. 'N' last year it grew about a metre <E1 mm> <P1 mhm good>. Sixteen seventeen years old by the way <E1 yep> and it grew about a metre still no fruit. This year has grown again and I actually have walnuts on it <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] There you go.\n",
      "[C5] Your idea of the broom handle works absolutely beautifully.\n",
      "[E1] There you go.\n",
      "[C5] So I thought I'd ring you with that one.\n",
      "[P1] Good.\n",
      "[C5] The other reason why I called was uh I think I spoke to you again last year about uh anything to keep wallabies off the off the roses and it started again this year you haven't come up with anything since the last time <E1 laughs> we spoke apart from a bit of lead in their ear of course <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Ooh that's a bit rough isn't it.\n",
      "[E1] Um what about what about getting some blood 'n' bone.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] And putting some blood 'n' bone in a stocking.\n",
      "[C5] Ah.\n",
      "[E1] And hanging some blood 'n' bone in stockings around your roses.\n",
      "[C5] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] I do not believe they like the r the s the smell of the or the stench of rotting blood 'n' bone.\n",
      "[C5] Ooh I see that's worth a try. Uh.\n",
      "[P1] Mm. I'm not so crazy on it myself Greg but I suppose if it keeps the wallabies away <C5 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Well you could try that did I suggest to you that you try um spraying your roses with Seasol.\n",
      "[C5] No I do use a lotta Seasol in my gardening <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Okay well there's another one. Um I I believe it works to a certain point that if you if you spray your roses with Seasol uh both possums and wallabies don't like the smell and the taste of the seaweed <C5 right> okay but the only drawback is you've gotta regularly do that so you'd need to do it every mwah I'd say every week or thereabouts and ih c certainly after it's rained. But I would try that in or as a combination with the blood 'n' bone trick.\n",
      "[C5] I'll give that a try I tried a product last year that's uh well actually it's called Poss-Off <E1 yep uh> and that's got a chilli base I would suggest. When you're spraying it on it just about takes your breath away <E1 right>. But that didn't seem to work either <E1 didn't work> they they they <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Kept the possums away but not the wallabies.\n",
      "[C5] Exactly <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well wuh uh it's a known fact that wallabies like roses with chilli.\n",
      "[P1] Oh absolutely yes <E1 laughs>. Uh they're of Mexican uh descent aren't they <E1 and P1 laugh>.\n",
      "[C5] Actually I'll just tell you a quick little one that was in the Reader's Digest this month that uh there's a a story that the bees are going on strike.\n",
      "[P1] Uh yes.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C5] More honey and uh what is it uh more more honey and shorter flowers <P1 and E1 laugh>.\n",
      "[P1] Oh okay. I like that thanks Peter have a great Christmas.\n",
      "[C5] <inaudible> thanks.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Leon good afternoon how are you. Hello Leon. Are you there. No we've lost Leon. Carol might like to try and get Leon back Kath hello Kath.\n",
      "[E1] G'day Kath.\n",
      "[C6] Um last year I planted a Nelly Kelly passionfruit.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C6] Lots of foliage lots of flowers. They all dutifully produced little babies.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[C6] But they got to about the size of a large green olive they turned yellow and went soft.\n",
      "[E1] And there's nothing inside them.\n",
      "[C6] There's nothing inside them so I lost my temper with it.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[C6] Cut it right back all I had left was stem I ignore that completely. I don't water it I don't feed it. It's covered in foliage it's starting to flower is it going to happen again.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C6] So what's the what is the problem.\n",
      "[E1] Right well the deal with that Kath is that Nelly Kelly passionfruits are grafted <C6 mhm> okay. Now what's happened is.\n",
      "[C6] Keep an eye on the um.\n",
      "[E1] On the suckers.\n",
      "[C6] On the suckers.\n",
      "[E1] Right but at some stage your plant has suckered and your graft has died and now all you're l you're left with is a sucker.\n",
      "[C6] Right the whole thing comes out <E1 tt> then <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] That's exactly right the whole things come comes out you've gotta buy yourself a new one <C6 yeah> and then for the first twelve to eighteen months <,> every so often go out and just check the graft and make sure nothing's suckering from underneath and it should be fine.\n",
      "[C6] Oh goody I'll get one.\n",
      "[E1] But that's what's wrong with it unfortunately.\n",
      "[C6] I'll go buy a new one next week.\n",
      "[E1] Mm hmm okay.\n",
      "[C6] <inaudible> it'll be my Christmas present. Thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Good on you <E1 thanks Kath> Kath have a nice Christmas. Leon we've got you back hello Leon.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[C7] I want to strike some petenia cuttings <E1 yeah>. Uh uh which is the best time of the year to take those.\n",
      "[E1] Right now Leon.\n",
      "[C7] Right now.\n",
      "[E1] Right now because the new growth from the Spring that goes really hot fiery red in colour <C7 yeah> has hardened off <C7 oh yes>. Now now's the time of the year to take the cuttings so <,> what you need to do is take your cuttings from the eastern side of the bush <C7 yep>. And the reason for that is because all the carbohydrates are in the eastern sunny side of the bush <,> um take the b the c cuttings around about pen or pencil thickness <C7 yes>. And around about in old terms three inches long.\n",
      "[C7] Okay yep.\n",
      "[E1] Alright. Strip the cutting back to two leaves at the top of the cutting <C7 mhm>. And then you can eih you can try two methods you can either dip your cuttings in uh a rooting gel. Don't buy the liquid or the powder buy the gel 'cos it's it's a better product these days so the rooting gel or you can dip the cuttings in some honey.\n",
      "[C7] I see yep yep.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah both of those will stimulate um root growth on your cuttings. They'll take around about oh around about four to six months to strike. So don't expect anything to happen within the four to six months. If for one reason or another the the cuttings start to flower then cut the flowers off <,> right <C7 yeah yes right yes>. And um I would take if I were you uh how many do you want.\n",
      "[C7] Oh probably uh a dozen.\n",
      "[E1] Alright well take about forty cuttings <C7 okay yeah>. Okay 'cos you'll find that if you get ten out of forty cuttings then you're doing pretty well.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah I just wondering see I don't think my <,> cuttings that I would take would be as thick as you were saying uh.\n",
      "[E1] Well look try and take them as thick as you possibly can.\n",
      "[C7] And how uh rigid h how stiff are they actually.\n",
      "[E1] Oh at this <C7 inaudible> well at this time of the year 'cos that new growth has hardened off <C7 yep> right it's reasonably stiff.\n",
      "[C7] So you don't want the ones that are that you can virtually bend over.\n",
      "[E1] If you can wrap your finger around the stem and you get a little bit of resistance <,> right <C7 yeah> then then they're ready to cut <C7 okay yep>. Okay if they're really s uh uh s uh well they're sitting bolt upright 'n' they're very stiff then no you can't take them <C7 okay wuh>. You still want a little bit of flexibility in the cutting.\n",
      "[C7] Good yes and uh w dampness wuh how how damp do I keep them.\n",
      "[E1] Uh you make sure that your your propagation mix is moist <C7 yes> but never saturated okay and <C7 inaudible> not too dry. It's a really difficult one. You do need to water them every day. So I'd water them religiously every morning and then if we have an exceptionally dry day then you'll need to water them again.\n",
      "[C7] Just with a spray over the leaves.\n",
      "[E1] Uh yes but you wanna keep the mix wet not the leaves.\n",
      "[C7] Good okay then.\n",
      "[E1] Alright.\n",
      "[C7] Yes.\n",
      "[P1] Okay Leon.\n",
      "[C7] Good thanks very much.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you very much for your call it is nine minutes to three thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred the number to call.\n",
      "[P1] It's Trevor Jackson with Greg Kerrin for the last time this year by by the way uh for Gardening Talkback so your last chance to have a chat to Greg before we resume the program um uh towards the end of January next year. Bill from Moonah g'day Bill.\n",
      "[E1] G'day Bill.\n",
      "[P1] What can we do for you Bill.\n",
      "[C8] I wanna kill something.\n",
      "[E1] Oh.\n",
      "[P1] Oh <C8 um>. That doesn't suh. Sounds a bit nasty.\n",
      "[C8] <inaudible> nextdoor neighbour and I have joined forces uh to get rid of the ivy on our fence which is tearing the fence down. What's the best stuff to.\n",
      "[E1] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Vhoo.\n",
      "[C8] Wuh we've got the ivy out alright but of course it's roots everywhere.\n",
      "[P1] Ivy's tough very tough.\n",
      "[E1] 'N' you've got a you got a coalition of uh <P1 laughs> neighbours there Bill <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] They call you the ivy league <P1 and E1 laugh>.\n",
      "[E1] Um to kill ivy look um blackberry and tree killer <C18 yeah> would be the best thing to use.\n",
      "[C8] Spray it on or paint it on.\n",
      "[E1] Tt uh uh have you got exposed stems. Or have you got foliage.\n",
      "[C8] I've got foliage galore <E1 mm> and also where we've been pulling it out there's it's rooted <E1 yep>. I haven't got all the roots out.\n",
      "[E1] Okay um <,> I I would say for you the easiest thing to do would be to spray the foliage <C8 yeah>. Now please read the directions <C8 yeah> when you purchase the blackberry tree killer and make sure that you follow all the precautions <C8 yes>. It's most important um you will need to apply it more than once <,> maybe up to three or four times uh over three weeks <C8 oh right> and that should knock the ivy back but be warned it's gunna come back again and yih it will take you probably twelve months to knock it off.\n",
      "[C8] Oh.\n",
      "[E1] So you're just gunna have to keep at it 'n' at it 'n' at it 'n' at it 'n' at it. It's one of those one of those pesty sort of weeds when it when it invades your garden to the extent that it has yours and your neighbour's you've just gotta keep at it all the time <C8 uh>. One spray won't kill it.\n",
      "[C8] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] Alright <C8 thanks> so just bear that in mind. But good luck that'll do it Bill.\n",
      "[C8] Thanks very much <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Bill.\n",
      "[E1] Thanks Bill.\n",
      "[P1] Okay have a great Christmas. Mm Iris. Good afternoon Iris.\n",
      "[P1] Yes how are things in Bridgewater this afternoon.\n",
      "[C9] Oh it's a bit chilly we've got a sea breeze.\n",
      "[P1] Oh. That's lovely uh the the the nice refreshing change to yesterday.\n",
      "[C9] Oh yes if only we'd get some rain.\n",
      "[P1] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] <inaudible> need it.\n",
      "[P1] It's been trying though all day.\n",
      "[C9] It has been. Yes my problem is I've mentioned to you before about soil wetting agents.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C9] Now when I put that on do I water my lawn first or do I just water the lawn with the the soil wetter and then put the hose on it.\n",
      "[E1] Are you which one are you using Iris.\n",
      "[C9] Well it's one that I mix in granules in a bucket 'n' then put it in a c watering can.\n",
      "[E1] And then water it on.\n",
      "[C9] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. Well you don't need to water the lawn first <C9 oh right> right. You only ih if you mixing it up with water <C9 yes> then just apply it <,> that way <C9 right>. Right there's no wat need to wet the lawn first because if you saturate the lawn or saturate the lawn before you you put your wetting agent down <C9 mm> um there's a good chance that it will flood all into one spot in the lawn <C9 oh right> rather than getting an even distribution right across the lawn so just just use that uh uh mixture you've got in the watering can and apply it that way.\n",
      "[C9] And when do I water it afterwards with a sprinkler.\n",
      "[E1] No.\n",
      "[C9] No okay.\n",
      "[E1] No let it soak in Iris <C9 yes> and then tomorrow or the day after you can start watering again but you're gunna find that it will reduce your uh watering by about oh <,> three or four quarters.\n",
      "[C9] Oh that'll be lovely.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[C9] Mm.\n",
      "[P1] Oh okay.\n",
      "[C9] Okay thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Iris thank you very much for your call <C9 okay>. And uh Greg uh who're we gunna pick as our winner this afternoon who should it be.\n",
      "[E1] Um well look I think Iris from Sandy Bay with her irises <P1 okay> that was just <P1 laughs> <,> a good question.\n",
      "[P1] Alright and just tickled your fancy just a little bit.\n",
      "[E1] Absolutely.\n",
      "[P1] Greg Kerrin uh from uh Carol and myself a big thankyou for your involvement in the program this year all of your uh participation and uh look forward to having you back next year you will come back won't you.\n",
      "[E1] I'll be back.\n",
      "[P1] Alright.\n",
      "COME1-raw.txt\n",
      "[P1] Between now and nine good morning sunshine.\n",
      "[E1] Good morning you how are you.\n",
      "[P1] Fantas.\n",
      "[E1] Good morning everyone welcome to the Garden Clinic program on 2 G B it's lovely to have your company with us this morning and we're going into the garden where it's nice and peaceful and quiet and lovely.\n",
      "[P1] And wet.\n",
      "[E1] And wet <laughs> sopping ih fa in fact absolutely so wet out there isn't it wonderful. And if anyone complains about it disturbing a a function or an event this afternoon <P1 they will> naughty <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] They will get a.\n",
      "[E1] Big smacks <laughs>. Absolutely incredible amounts of rain I hope your garden's looking gorgeous. Mine certainly is I'm sure it's grown about five inches over the last week wonderful rain in Sydney and uh and throughout the suburbs. Absolutely terrific we've got a full board of calls but of course you if you wanna ring in one-three-one-eight-seven-three lots of prizes to give away today as well lots of little gardening surprises so stay tuned we've got our lucky member's prize a g really good prize today Yates Pest Oil which I think always comes in handy and let's go to Anne at Bradbury good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Okay well I would just prune it equally all over <C1 right> and not touch that side.\n",
      "[C1] Oh okay.\n",
      "[E1] The extra sunlight and space that it now has because you've removed the succulent will encourage the growth on that side anyway.\n",
      "[C1] Started to all.\n",
      "[E1] Exactly and it might take two two years or three years to uh equal out uh but that's really all you can do and of course um spraying or watering with the uh seaweed solutions <C1 yep> whether you choose Maxicrop Seasol or any of the other seaweeds on the market I'm.\n",
      "[C1] We've got the Maxicrop.\n",
      "[E1] Beautiful <C1 yes> well that's excellent in fact Maxicrop's terrific.\n",
      "[C1] But how much do you prune where do you prune down to ab.\n",
      "[E1] Well I like to just prune ih depending on the bush of course um a well pruned and well maintained bush should only need y y'know two or three inches all over <C1 inaudible> basically the flowerheads.\n",
      "[C1] Oh okay that's what <E1 you keep it> we weren't sure about we <E1 nice and> we didn't want to cut it drastically and discover that was the wrong thing to do.\n",
      "[E1] You can prune drastically don't get me wrong <C1 right> if something's been let go a cam an azalea is looking completely outright freaky cam <C1 inaudible> y'know sometimes it gets out of control <C1 no it's not>. You can prune them back hard but no in your case um a short back and sides Anne for you a like <C1 laughs> a boy's haircut.\n",
      "[C1] <laughs> Okay thanks for that.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you.\n",
      "[C1] Have a nice day.\n",
      "[E1] You too good bye.\n",
      "[C1] Bye.\n",
      "[E1] Hello Iris.\n",
      "[E1] Yes chryslyha <C2 inaudible> chrysanthemums.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah. But we wanna put the vegies back in in the winter can we dig these over not the chrysanthemums but the others.\n",
      "[E1] Um.\n",
      "[C2] Um or should we pull them up and put them in the um compost bin which is best.\n",
      "[E1] The latter <C2 pull them up>. Put them put them in the p compost bin <C2 right> if they were legumious {leguminous} for example legumes like peas <C2 yes> beans <C2 inaudible> or anyth yeah anything that y'know fixes nitrogen <C2 yes>. Uh like pea-shaped flowers <C2 right> then I would definitely um build it into the soil <C2 right>. But with those annuals I would just put them into the compost and let them compost down.\n",
      "[C2] Compost down with the chrysanthemums 'cos they would keep going could we dig them up and move them and what time of the year is the best time of the year.\n",
      "[E1] Well you could do that now <C2 could do that now> I suppose <C2 alright> yes it's such a lovely w week really <C2 inaudible> uh we're getting such nice m wuh mild weather I know it's gunna heat up and today will be quite warm <C2 right>. But uh uh I imagine from looking at the weather forecast <C2 right> but uh yes chrysanthemums are perennials <C2 yes> uh and they do flower in in uh for yuh in Autumn for <C2 right> Mother's Day <C2 yep> uh and so moving it now is really at the beginning of its life cycle <C2 so its a good time> if you think about yeah the 'n' y y'know y you you'd have a good success rate if you moved it.\n",
      "[C2] Okay thank you very much.\n",
      "[E1] My pleasure Iris <C2 thank you>. Good luck <C2 alright> that sounds lots of fun converting <C2 yep> a flower patch into a vegie patch.\n",
      "[P1] She's got a big day ahead a fun day <E1 laughs> twelve minutes past six shall we go to Greg.\n",
      "[E1] Let's go to Greg. Good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Right good well that's great then no spraying <laughs> what what would you want to spray it against what are you getting with your plum tree <C3 uh fruit> how.\n",
      "[C3] Yeah fruit fly.\n",
      "[E1] Well that's fine you don't have to spray with um to prevent floo fruit fly <C3 mhm>. When the um plums are starting.\n",
      "[C3] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Then you just put a fruit fly dak pot in the tree.\n",
      "[C3] A dak pot.\n",
      "[E1] A dak pot <C3 okay> um and you use some insect killer uh uh there's a one on the market called um uh basically I just think it's called in in fruit fra fruit fly insect killer <C3 oh okay> and you mix a few little drops of that um into um vegemite and honey <C3 okay> and you put that into uh a dak pot or which is duh y'know just a a plastic drink container <C3 yes> um with some holes and and um some plugs around the outside just so the um uh the fruit fly has an entrance to get in <C3 okay> now the the sweetness of that mix attracts the fruit fly and then the the few drops you could just use the fr um y'know that if you wanted to do an organic method <C3 okay> just the the vegemite and the honey or peanut butter mixed in together <C3 yes> because they usually can't get out. They usually feed themselves <C3 uhuh>. Um but if you want to make it a little bit more potent you could just add a few drops of that fruit fly um uh uh ih in insecticide in there.\n",
      "[C3] Oh okay thanks a lot for that.\n",
      "[E1] No worries no spraying nice and easy and safe.\n",
      "[C3] Okay thanks a lot.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you Greg.\n",
      "[C3] Thank you goodbye.\n",
      "[E1] Bye-bye <P1 we'll take a quick> and that can be done of course with all fruit. Sorry darling <P1 oh>. Peaches plums apples uh or anything that gets the fruit fly you can put the fruit fly dak pots in.\n",
      "[P1] Uh I was about to say we'll take a break uh the you're right about the weather today Linda you've been listening very carefully <E1 laughs> mainly sunny in Sydney's forecast today and a high of twenty-six degrees so a bit warmer <E1 mm>. Uh Liverpool twenty-nine and Richmond and Penrith thirty <E1 yes> today <E1 look at that> it's mainly sunny. Now Sunday few afternoon showers and thunderstorms. Sydney sixteen to twenty-three tomorrow so it will cool off so more showers on the way on Sunday but today should be mainly sunny a terrific day.\n",
      "[E1] Do you want me to tell you a little secret.\n",
      "[P1] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] Just quickly. Tomorrow is dad's birthday.\n",
      "[P1] Oh really.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[P1] And he's coming in.\n",
      "[E1] He's coming in.\n",
      "[P1] Oh.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] We'll bake a cake.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Taking calls in the Garden Clinic with Luke and Linda. Jenny from Kurrajong good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Oh I'm so glad we can be of help.\n",
      "[C4] I have started a garden completely from scratch and now my vegetable garden I've just started doing and um I've thought I've fed the soil very well and done all the right things I'm trying to go sort of organic.\n",
      "[E1] Good girl where are you in Kurrajong.\n",
      "[C4] I'm in Cedar Ridge ro.\n",
      "[E1] Oh I know that very well <C4 oh okay>. I used to live on East Kurrajong Road.\n",
      "[C4] Oh okay yes. Uh.\n",
      "[E1] A hard climate up there isn't it. Has it <C4 inaudible> been raining up there uh this week.\n",
      "[C4] Oh we've had the most incredible rain <E1 oh> absolutely.\n",
      "[E1] And the dams filling are they.\n",
      "[C4] Well the dams all around. As I drive I can hardly look at the road I just <E1 laughs> look at all the dams and they actually over so many are overflowing.\n",
      "[E1] Wonderful news.\n",
      "[C4] It's I've I've only been up here about eighteen months but it's just amazing.\n",
      "[E1] It's beautiful I was up there during the drought and it was really depressing and the fires actually that that the fires that Christmas.\n",
      "[C4] Yeah <E1 um> well we weren't here for the fires but I'm looking at one of my trees here it's must be about oh thirty metres high and there's it's <,> black right to the top.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C4] So.\n",
      "[E1] Well we lost a couple of houses in my road on that uh on that terrible Christmas. Um but I know a lot of them have been rebuilt and a lot of families starting from scratch but it's such a lovely community up there.\n",
      "[C4] Oh it is. It's.\n",
      "[E1] So your organic vegie patch <C4 yes it's>. You're starting from scratch.\n",
      "[C4] Actually growing in in polys in broccoli boxes 'cos you know what the soil's like <E1 yeah> up here so.\n",
      "[E1] Well the good news uh is up there you can get all of that horse manure.\n",
      "[C4] Yes I I I get a lot of the stuff and I get sheep manure and everything like that <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] That's what I grew my vegie patch out of when I was up there <C4 okay>. Basically completely cor uh well rotted horse manure.\n",
      "[C4] Okay. Now my problem is I've put in these little lettuce seedlings and they're only probably three inches high and I've only had planted them out about three weeks ago <E1 mm> but they're bolting to <E1 yeah> seed.\n",
      "[E1] That's because.\n",
      "[C4] What have I done wrong.\n",
      "[E1] Lettuce is really a cool climate crop.\n",
      "[C4] Ah.\n",
      "[E1] Which means that they're much better over autumn and winter than spring and summer. And because we had that really hot weather before we had the rain y'know those <C4 yes> thirty plus days. The sih um really hot weh weather uh induce lettuce to go straight to seed. Very very quickly so it's much better I know it's weird it I always <C4 I would never> find the irony <C4 inaudible>. The irony of the situation is that lettuce <P1 'cos it's a salad for summer> you eat in summer in summer <C4 yeah huh> but in fact it's really hard to grow in summer because if it's in a full sun position it will always bolt. Bolt <C4 I see> to seed which I love because it does bolt to seed it just elongates and off you go <C4 yeah>. So other.\n",
      "[C4] <inaudible> three inches high.\n",
      "[E1] Yep exactly <C4 laughs> it's so it's uh it's the irony of the gardening world so um.\n",
      "[P1] Put some shade cloth over it.\n",
      "[E1] Uh well uh in a shady sp a shadier spot <C4 I have had> but it's the heat is going to do it too.\n",
      "[C4] <inaudible> next to water tank so it's sort of half shade you know so.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah it I mean lettuce we m I say we dad had the best crop of lettuce and it's just at the end now uh of the uh uh he had uh he had seriously ten different types of lettuce I mean the types of wonderful lettuce you can get these days is just terrific <C4 mm> but I have to say he planted it in in uh winter. And it was the beautiful winter crop right through the cooler months um and now um in the vegie patch we should really be concentrating on all the Mediterranean vegetables uh basically um capsicum eggplant and um tomatoes zucchini and squash are all terrific. Now with the lettuce or the um the leafy vegetables concentrate on rocket. And um the rainbow chard spinach and things like oh y'know all the herbs <C4 okay>. 'Cos I make very herby salads in summer because the herbs do quite well. Basil and all of those sorts of things <C4 yeah>. But get them in now get all those herbs in now because planting them any later into the hot weather into summer and again they'll bolt to seed.\n",
      "[C4] Yes now I've got all those herbs in I ha I have it all that and I was thinking of trying to have my vegetables y'know all through the summer my own stuff so this has put paid to my theory.\n",
      "[E1] Yes <C4 laughs>. Get a good guh um vegetable book I tell you what my absolute oh bible is a book called The Complete Book of Vegetables Herbs and Fruit. Uh it's absolutely wonderful it's Cameron House is the publisher <C4 okay> it's quite a heavy book uh like it probably I call it my bible it's probably as heavy as a bible as well but I tell you what any time I need to know anything it's got everything about every fruit and herb and vegetable in it and such an amazing resource for you and just to let you know certain things about that lettuce not a good um warm uh month crop. S really concentrate on the rockets and the Mediterranean vegetables there Jenny and good luck with it.\n",
      "[P1] Very ironic that this wonderful summer salad <,> vegetable <coughs> doesn't like growing in summer <E1 laughs> but there you.\n",
      "[E1] Not not in Sydney that's for sure.\n",
      "[P1] But it's not your fault <E1 laughs>. Mila good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Hi Mila.\n",
      "[C5] Hi how are you.\n",
      "[E1] Good how are you.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah I got a problem on my peaches nectarines pree uh previous years I got a good fruit. But last year it's uh when you look outside it's okay but there is some black spots <E1 alright> on the fruit <E1 yeah> and when you open it's rotten <E1 right>. So I didn't get even one piece of of fruit.\n",
      "[E1] Well it's just a seasonal thing I wouldn't worry there's nothing you can do for this year Mila unfortunately sometimes fruit have better years than others and I think yes you've got a fungus and a and a and a rot in the fruit uh I really don't think there's much you can do uh at all this year you know you could next year um water in with uh anti-rot around the tree as a preventative for next year but uh nothing you can do this year unfortunately uh and I I would just fingers crossed that next year's fruit isn't um susceptible to the same rot.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for your call Mila we do have to leave it there um we've got Sandra's diary coming up soon and more of your calls are welcome on one-three-one-eight-seven-three you can call through now you're listening to the Garden Clinic on Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] Yes top of the morning to you nice to have your company Luke Bona here with Linda Ross this morning and some lines are available you <,> powered through some calls in that last half hour one-three-one-eight-seven-three and Two G B dot com you've got a couple of uh emails here Linda can I read one to you. Um in fact we did touch on this last week but you can uh you can repeat this it's from Manly Vale Elizabeth can pool water salted <,> be used on the garden ih uh it's nearly overflowing at the moment and instead of wasting it I would like to make use of it.\n",
      "[E1] Oh depends what you're growing but uh it really depends what you're growing I would worry about certain things uh so no. I would b I would be a little bit worried about this.\n",
      "[P1] Do you feel guilty when your <,> <E1 I know> when your pool is filled but it's it's also probably a very good opportunity for you to backwash your pool. Uh 'cos you gotta do that occasionally so if you got a it's it's a salt water pool so you've probably got a cartridge. Uh and anyone with a Diatomaceous Earth filter if your pool is full and ih you do feel terribly guilty running that water off but give it a backwash 'n' <,> and that's the time to do it I su I suppose.\n",
      "[E1] Thanks Luke. Yes I would very worried a lot of plants hate salt and uh and a lotta plants won't even grow around a salt water pool just because of the splash of the salt water. Okay straight out to Pamela at Normanhurst good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Terrific.\n",
      "[C6] I've got a lovely bush garden uh surrounded by trees turpentine gums <E1 mm>. Uh azaleas and um tree ferns and um <,> tt yes. And I've been given a stag horn for a birthday present it's very healthy and I want to know how to keep it healthy <E1 laughs>. And where I should hang it what aspect.\n",
      "[E1] Well I like to keep my stag horns in morning sun. Uh or dappled shade considering that's where they grow <C6 yes> I mean I have seen up in Dorrigo I go bushwalking um through those mountains and the stag horns up there are just incredible. And they like dappled sun under turpentines or under eucalypts that's where they grow so your environment there at Normanhurst will be perfect a dappled sun just as long as you're not getting any of the hot afternoon sun.\n",
      "[C6] Yes that's what I was thinking because there are parts of the garden that get the westerly sun.\n",
      "[E1] Yes. As all gardens <C6 do>. But try not to try to protect it from the hot afternoon sun uh but and I mean I have seen stag horns very healthy stag horns and quite robust in full sun but they have become that way over a long period of time and they've hardened up <C6 yes>. Uh but uh young ha stag horns uh th really you know they're th <,> th the best uh position is dappled shade under trees <C6 right>. And looking after them is <C6 yes> quite easy. They really don't mind just using the rain that falls and whatever falls into their lovely foliage sort of catchment <C6 yes> uh as fertiliser. You can every now and then shoot some seaweed up into them if they're up in a tree <C6 yes> um by clicking onto uh a seaweed uh thing onto the hose and just squirting it <C6 alright> because they do let those lovely foliage <C6 yeah> um curved foliage take up the nutrient through the leaf <C6 yes>. Um and the only other thing I would m be mindful of is the stag horn or elk horn beetle. That does a lot of damage <C6 uhuh>. Uh and you can see it um eating through the the the big beautiful f um leaf uh foliages uh f with the stag horn beetle and the only thing that really nips that in the bud is using Confidor but I would just be mindful of that.\n",
      "[C6] Yes the other thing I have are possums.\n",
      "[E1] Oh.\n",
      "[C6] Do possums like stag horn.\n",
      "[E1] Not really.\n",
      "[C6] Oh good <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Possums like other things like roses.\n",
      "[C6] I'm tried with possums all the time I've had <inaudible> roses with it with a possum proof fence round them I'm hoping I'm going to get some <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well hopefully the r the possum won't go for the stag horn although if the possum's very hungry it probably <C6 laughs> will um uh there are uh other plants that possums would prefer <C6 good> magnolia buds rosebuds <laughs>.\n",
      "[C6] Oh you're very encouraging <E1 laughs>. Thank you very much. Good.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you Pamela.\n",
      "[C6] <inaudible> other thing I must tell you which annoys me intensely I have an easement at the bottom of my garden and all this beautiful water going to waste down the drain.\n",
      "[E1] Yes luh uh I think everyone's sort of well anyone.\n",
      "[C6] <inaudible> you can do about it.\n",
      "[E1] There's <sighs> I've been listening to the government this week <C6 yes> talking about uh all of their solutions for water in this nation and this c in this beautiful city of ours. And I just think um y'know what all we can do as as home owners and and gardeners is capture as much of the rain that falls in our properties with a rainwater tank and use it on our garden and start at a grassroots level capture the uh s the rain um ih if you wanna divert that water flow ih um into a a a po a pool or something a pond um really um to yuh hook up the the roof uh with a water tank and see if we can capture as much as we can and then use that uh for our gardens I think that's just the easiest most simple idea and to know that that rebate for a rainwater tank has been extended to July two-thousand-and-eight where homeowners get six-hundred-and-fifty dollars rebate uh for installing a rainwater tank now there's so many wun wonderful tanks out there Pamela. Have you thought about that.\n",
      "[C6] Yes I am thinking about it yes indeed.\n",
      "[E1] I mean there's so many good dis uh tanks there's just the corrugated iron ones that look they're in a homestead out back <laughs> uh there's some slimline g rectangular tanks that actually fit down the side passages of our homes and driveways they're really very uh functional uh the other one I really like is a bladder system which I which operates as a an a a flexible bladder um and you can put it under the house or under a deck. It's Rain Reviver that's the company that does it and that means it's out of the way uh if it's hard y'know if you've got no space around your uh house these systems uh I think are absolutely ingenious and an an Australian invention I was looking up on the web uh last weekend that's Rain Reviver and they operate as big um like pillow shaped packages really that just open and contract and expand as the water goes in and you just flow the water in and then you can use it for whatever you need to the garden or or flushing the toilet or or uh or whatever. Uh uh a really wonderful Australian invention that's a bladder system from Rain Reviver but of course so many t types of rainwater tanks out there for us to choose from.\n",
      "[P1] Do you know what else there is now. Y you'll love this. If you're constructing a new home <,> walls and instead of having a concrete wall which is um ma maybe three hundred mils wide it's hollow <E1 yeah you can> and it contains water.\n",
      "[E1] Using the cavity in the wall.\n",
      "[P1] How good is that.\n",
      "[E1] Terrific and I saw another one that the walls of a shed like a <P1 yeah> garden shed were about a foot wide and they also were a reservoir for water as well a lot of people uh are using their brains to come up with very lateral ways of capturing water um on our gardens and I think if we can't um go forward uh as um um y'know it has been very o obvious from last week uh I think y'know gardeners can really make the solutions uh in their homes and in their gardens.\n",
      "[P1] It's a quarter to seven here at Two G B the Garden Clinic now if you lis listen very carefully between now and nine because <,> we'll be giving away uh thank you very much to um the f the people at Munns Munns quality garden products Australian owned since nineteen-forty-eight we have a golf course green lawn fertiliser five kilo bag two organic garden booster bags they're five kilos each the pack is worth fifty dollars we'll ask our Munns garden question between now and nine stay listening the first correct caller through when we give you a queue to call is today's winner.\n",
      "[P1] Hello Glad.\n",
      "[E1] Hello hello how are you.\n",
      "[C7] Fine thank you.\n",
      "[E1] That's good wha.\n",
      "[C7] Um my problem is um <,> tt uh pride of Madeira. It's the first year that I've had it that it's flowered.\n",
      "[E1] Wonderful how long has it taken to flower for Glad.\n",
      "[C7] Um well it's probably been in um oh perhaps twelve months.\n",
      "[E1] Oh well that's very lucky mine took four years to flower.\n",
      "[C7] Did it oh no <E1 laughs> it hasn't been in that long. And uh now it's it's um <,> y'know it it has flowered and with this rain it's all droopy what do I do with it.\n",
      "[E1] Prune it back.\n",
      "[C7] Just prune.\n",
      "[E1] Prune all those flowerheads off I mean the pride of Madeira is just a favourite of mine for its stunning purple flowers. I mean some of them get about two foot long <C7 yes> and um and of course it's very drought tolerant a very waterwise plant doesn't need much water at all Mediterranean sort of plant <C7 mm> um like the lavenders and oh just stunning. But I would pr ih mine is droopy too um because of course they've got big heads of flowers and when they get wet they droop um just with the weight of the rain in them.\n",
      "[C7] And would I cut all those spikes.\n",
      "[E1] You can cut all those spikes back.\n",
      "[C7] Right <E1 yeah> and it's next to a curl tree. Would their root systems.\n",
      "[E1] No they'll be fine together <C7 get hurt>. Very happy together.\n",
      "[C7] Oh good.\n",
      "[E1] Thanks Glad.\n",
      "[C7] Thank you very much.\n",
      "[E1] I'm growing the tower of jewels uh pride of Madeira which I have to say maybe mum and dad mentioned it uh is probably three metres high with flower spikes about five foot long um uh unbelievable we're taking a photo and putting it into uh the magazine but it is probably three metres lo it's certainly taller than dad um so at least three metres tall uh and the flower spikes in excess of one metre tall unbelievable tower of jewels it's a a new variety of the pride of Madeira but certainly a big one for the garden let's go straight to Sally good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Excellent how are you.\n",
      "[C8] Not too bad thank you.\n",
      "[E1] Good.\n",
      "[C8] Now before I start on what I wanted I heard you advertising the white cedar which I agree is a beautiful tree.\n",
      "[E1] Not advertising but just mentioning yes <laughs>.\n",
      "[C8] Well mentioning right okay but but please may I warn any of your listeners who are thinking of investing in it that that the caterpillar that you mentioned <,> is a hairy brute and a lot of children are allergic to it. And it wanders into the house and you're likely to find its pupa uh c uh when it uh pupates before beforming the moth anywhere. And we had a terrible trouble because my nephew was allergic to it.\n",
      "[E1] Oh dear it can become a problem yes.\n",
      "[C8] It can be uh but if if they do as you said put the canvass around the thing <,> and kill them all off every morning <,> then you can keep the wretches down to control.\n",
      "[E1] Good <both laugh>. A pretty tree though.\n",
      "[C8] It's a beautiful tree I agree very pretty. And it's a light foliage it's not one of those very heavy dense.\n",
      "[E1] That's true.\n",
      "[C8] So you can grow other things underneath it.\n",
      "[E1] Exactly.\n",
      "[C8] And at this time of year you've got the very very pretty flowers but people need to don't put it outside the bedroom door of y bedroom window of your favourite son or you you'll wake him up itching in the middle of the night.\n",
      "[E1] Oh one for a property maybe.\n",
      "[C8] Well that's that's right or as ou out the front gate where the it can drop on the passers-by y'know.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah <laughs> a <C8 inaudible> good street tree.\n",
      "[C8] Naughty naughty aren't I. Okay now um what I was wanting to know is do you know anything about <,> pruning paw pawpaw trees.\n",
      "[E1] No why would you.\n",
      "[C8] Well I've got two and the um I'm looking out the back window now at the plain ordinary orange one which is five metres tall. And I cannot get the fruit <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Oh dear.\n",
      "[C8] The possum's eaten half of half the big one.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C8] And I'm just going to try and recruit the friend up the street to bring his long ladder down as <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Yes you need a a a sparky or someone or a chippie with a really long ladder.\n",
      "[C8] Well yes exactly but I'm just wondering what would happen if I chop it off will it shoot out again.\n",
      "[E1] It probably will but it's not uh um advisable.\n",
      "[C8] It's not advisable.\n",
      "[E1] No uh I mean there are smaller growing pawpaws to grow Sally and you <C8 inaudible> might like to get.\n",
      "[C8] It was just it was just from a seed.\n",
      "[E1] Yes well that's right but there are varieties.\n",
      "[C8] Mm see um I've got the um bisexual red and it's the same but fortunately it's right beside the garage so we can shin up on it and get <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] That's an im that's a very good thing a good solution plant it near a house or a t or a shed or something but no they're tall trees you can get smaller varieties and if you were looking for the s um named varieties I would definitely go to uh Daleys Fruit Tree Nursery or look them up on the web uh they're just the best Australian uh fruit nursery they do mail order and I'll just give you uh their email address um which is Emma at Daleys fruit dot com dot A U um Daleys spelt D A L E Y S and they specialise in subtropical fruit and nuts uh lots of pawpaws there uh macadamias herbs I mean terrific passion fruit custard apples avocadoes mangoes as well so if you're interested in subtropical fruit Daleys Fruit n Nursery is just wonderful it's at Kyogle but they do mail order and I'm sure they've got a smaller dwarf growing um pawpaw but uh I would not recommend a pruning.\n",
      "[P1] Three minutes to seven Two G B the Garden Clinic with Linda Ross.\n",
      "[P1] Good morning and welcome to another Sydney weekend Luke Bona here with Linda Ross and the Garden Clinic after nine as uh the man just said Sydney Real Estate with Mark Moraza and between ten and twelve today it is Your Health with Dr Graham a big line up today but Linda's here one-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number and.\n",
      "[E1] She'll do in the meantime.\n",
      "[P1] Listen can I can you quickly um answer this you'll do this in two seconds this is from Michelle <,> from Harrington Park. Hi Linda I have a Chinese lucky bamboo that is looking very sick. It is kept in a narrow glass vase with glass rocks the roots appear to be orange and the smell of the water is disgusting <E1 laughs>. I have two shoots one is yellow half way up the stem the other appears to be okay. The leaves are wilting and yellow can I save my plant love Michelle..\n",
      "[E1] Oh. Okay new water. There is a fertiliser a liquid fertiliser Michelle that uh is actually named Lucky Bamboo and it's particularly for the water of the plant now it needs a really light bright spot as you can imagine ih something that's just growing in water needs a lot of uh sunshine to help photosynthesis and and good strong healthy growth. So I would go to my local nursery and I would buy the liquid fertiliser that's for lucky bamboo. They made one particularly for it because of course it's uh it's a soluble thing that's not it doesn't grow in in soil that's my first step um secondly I would put it in a really light bright sunshiny spot in the house so good luck with it I hope it uh <,> gets a little bit healthier in the next couple of weeks for you. Okay straight to Balgowlah good morning John.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you.\n",
      "[C9] Uh my little problem is concerns a a <,> Tahitian lime which I put in that's about seven years old now <E1 mm> and uh buh as we're moving I've had to repot it I've pulled it out and it's now in a pot. Uh we've cut it back considerably <E1 mhm> and some of the b some of the little branches are starting to die off and some are staying nice and green. Uh will you say what should I do. S s anything I can <E1 mm> help it with at all.\n",
      "[E1] Well the thing is it's probably in shock. 'Cos you've severed the roots.\n",
      "[C9] Yeah well that makes two of us.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> And unfortun uh was it a big big tree.\n",
      "[C9] Oh ih cuh about two metres.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah see that's quite <C9 metre and a half> la and when was this done John.\n",
      "[C9] Oh about a month ago.\n",
      "[E1] Oh okay. Okay so what is what's happening is the tree has exploded into new growth probably like its sap's moving around and then you've come along and cut the roots. So it's just stressed out but what I would do in these situations when I'm transplanting anything out of the garden into a pot into a new spot um spray with Stress Guard. And it is uh um it covers the leaf and it stops the leaf from losing moisture. It basically stops moisture loss from transpiration uh really helpful uh at a time like this <C9 inaudible>. What what it will do is dry out. Because the water uh ih it'll be stressed the roots actually can't take any moisture in and the leaves are giving moisture off so it's uh that's will ench eventually happen it'll dry out and die so the Stress Guard is very very good in this sort of situation when you're transplanting something not in autumn or winter <C9 mm> and uh and as an evergreen um plant of c ih it should be moved in autumn so we're a little bit late <C9 yeah how> but Stress Guard it. Which is a spray that you can spray over all of the leaves <C9 yes>. Um and that stops any moisture being lost and that will help I would've liked that to be have done before you did it but now is still very good you'll get uh you ih will be very useful and just water the roots every week with seaweed solution.\n",
      "[C9] Uhuh that's the key one thanks very much.\n",
      "[E1] That's the key.\n",
      "[C9] Okay doke.\n",
      "[E1] Both of those now if you wanna hold on there John I'll send you out some Maxicrop <C9 mm> fr um which is a s wonderful seaweed solution uh so if you just hold on there <C9 inaudible> I'll get your address and we'll send you some Maxicrop because no n uh as well as as um you using the Maxicrop now while it's in a pot when it gets into its new location <C9 mm> it needs to be regularly watered with um s uh Maxicrop as well.\n",
      "[C9] Is it will it survive in a pot.\n",
      "[E1] It will survive in a pot a lot of Tahitian limes which I call the gin and tonic tree grow very well in big pots <C9 oh>. So yes.\n",
      "[C9] Yes it's in a big one.\n",
      "[E1] Is it in a big pot.\n",
      "[C9] Fairly big yes.\n",
      "[E1] Something like a um eventually a half wine barrel is a <C9 yeah> good size for <C9 inaudible> a a a Tahitian lime.\n",
      "[C9] Great.\n",
      "[E1] Okay <C9 thank you for your help>. Terrific my pleasure John just remember also that uh citrus need to be fertilised three times a year they're very hungry uh but not for you right now let's wait till it gets a little bit better and it regenerates from it's uh huge shock and anyone else who's got citrus spring winter and autumn. Feed three times a year. Straight to Dorothy good morning Dorothy.\n",
      "[P1] Do they call you Dot.\n",
      "[C10] Y no really I'm a Dorothy Norman <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Very good.\n",
      "[E1] She's a Dorothy Dorothy <C10 laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Very good.\n",
      "[E1] How can we help you.\n",
      "[C10] I have a buffalo lawn in trouble.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C10] Now it gets the sun all in summer all day but in winter about a quarter of it is mostly in shade <E1 right>. But it's always survived <E1 yep>. Now this year I've had an absolute mat of weed in this area <E1 yep>. I've dug it out but most of the buffalo is dead underneath <E1 mhm> and the area seems to be almost rotted.\n",
      "[E1] Yes. The shade and the um the wi.\n",
      "[C10] <inaudible> water I suppose.\n",
      "[E1] That's right. D'y'know what I would think about doing Dorothy I know uh eh uh y'know I'd have liked the garden to be as easy and as trouble free as possible. The quarter is it under a tree that doesn't get the sun.\n",
      "[C10] No no it's some trees um from next door.\n",
      "[E1] Trees from next door. I would think about not having lawn there.\n",
      "[C10] Oh.\n",
      "[E1] Because it problem is gunna happen <C10 look I'm> year after year after year. The.\n",
      "[C10] Well this is the first year it's happened <E1 yes>. I get a few weeds but I take them out and I never have any trouble.\n",
      "[E1] With the um the m harder um environment that we've gotta garden with now with the um the very dry winter we had with the druh well the drought really whether you wanna call it a drought or just y'know no rain <C10 yeah> <laughs>. Na a natural sort of r um climatic condition that we have at the moment the lawn in that area will constantly each year um find it harder and harder to uh grow after the winter.\n",
      "[C10] What about the shade resistant buffalo.\n",
      "[E1] Shade tolerant buffalo is a good one <C10 inaudible> sh called Shademaster. But again complete shade over winter it will struggle to get back. Uh in in it's so hard to get mm a lawn growing in these areas but Shademaster is a terrific one but better in dappled shade obviously not full shade.\n",
      "[C10] Well it's not full shade.\n",
      "[E1] Okay <C10 but uh>. Well Shademaster is a great alternative.\n",
      "[C10] Now what about this mat of uh it almost looks like um uh well uh I suppose it's rotted dowh lawn and rotted weed. I've tried to scrape it up but it it looks as though it will need something a fungus spray or something on it.\n",
      "[E1] Well if it sounds like if if it's a whole lot of weeds and a whole loh um it it needs to be replaced.\n",
      "[C10] Yes I'll have to replace it.\n",
      "[E1] So maybe you would like to replace it um with the Shademaster uh lawns are it's it's such a hard thing I mean my I've totally relaxed my uh feelings of lawn I have because I am not prepared to water my lawn. Uh with the water restrictions and so it must stand up for itself so dad and I were laughing at it because it's more clover but I have the greenest sh c l I know that will horrify some of you lawn experts out there but it's a quite a green lawn I mow the lawh mow the clo clover and uh the dandelion and it's quite quite fine and uh of course I don't have to water it and it's n really nice and green so sometimes we have to l relax our feelings when it comes to lawn with the drought and uh the water restrictions. But in your case maybe now is time to replace it with a shade tolerant lawn like Shademaster.\n",
      "[P1] Lucky members for today the twenty-third and Mrs Elizabeth Disney.\n",
      "[E1] What a cute name.\n",
      "[P1] Related to Walt Disney.\n",

      "[P1] It's eighteen past seven.\n",
      "[P1] Nora from Dover Heights good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Hello Nora how are you.\n",
      "[C11] Good thank you.\n",
      "[E1] Long time no speak.\n",
      "[C11] Well absolutely except I think Lara rang you <E1 I s> a couple of weeks ago.\n",
      "[E1] Lara was just adorable.\n",
      "[C11] Um Linda we put in a jacaranda in a sheltered position.\n",
      "[E1] Where did you buy it from.\n",
      "[C11] From a nursery.\n",
      "[E1] Good yep.\n",
      "[C11] <inaudible> four years ago <E1 right> but not one sign of a little purple flower. Now my neighbour tells me you've gotta wait for seven years but I see trees that look smaller than mine <E1 yeah> it must be about eight foot now <E1 yeah> and and and they've got flowers on them so can I do anything or is it a dud.\n",
      "[E1] Not really and don't know <laughs>.\n",
      "[C11] Oh right dih buy another one.\n",
      "[E1] Very hard to know <C11 yep> um at the nursery they do um you do buy uh guaranteed to flower plants <C11 yeah> now I mean all nurseries should be um gr um selling um plants that are guaranteed to flower <C11 yeah>. Uh that's just y'know uh absolutely given when you buy a jacaranda. If you had um propagated a jacaranda from seed <C11 no> I would say yes seven years to flower and maybe never <C11 right> but because you have bought it from the nursery I'd say ih there's a hundred percent um chance that it will flower.\n",
      "[C11] Oh uh oh eventually.\n",
      "[E1] Eventually <C11 and and>. And it might take a couple of.\n",
      "[C11] <inaudible> no idea of the time it.\n",
      "[E1] Not not really I mean sometimes a a jacaranda takes seven years uh to feel comfortable enough to flower <C11 okay>. But um uh and um and sometimes those ones that you see that are flowering young ones.\n",
      "[C11] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] They've been in a pot for a long time <C11 ah>. So what they think they ac they actually trick themselves into thinking that they're older than they are because their root space is completely taken up with roots <C11 right>. And uh a plant uh oh ov often will fruit and flower when it's in a pot because it feels like it's mature <C11 yeah> 'cos there's no more space for the roots <C11 alright> to grow.\n",
      "[C11] Don't chop it down <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] No I I'd give it a couple more years Nora.\n",
      "[C11] Alright <E1 laughs> thanks Linda.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you.\n",
      "[C11] Bye.\n",
      "[E1] Bye-bye and gee I can just see a mauvy tint across the uhs the city this week as the jacarandas are just about to burst into flower absolutely my favourite time of the year because it coincides with my birthday ha ha but if you'd like to join us on the jacaranda cruise you can we've got three beautiful cruises to celebrate jacarandas and Sydney um ring nine-four-eight-four-five-one-hundred if you wanna join the Ross family on the harbour for three hours stuff yourself with uh muffins and have a cup of tea with us that's coming up in November. Straight to Baulkham Hills Dorothy good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you for listening <C12 and I'm> Dorothy.\n",
      "[C12] Having problems with my b well I'm not problems with my blue potato vine.\n",
      "[E1] Oh wonderful thing to grow we don't really talk about it much.\n",
      "[C12] No this is why I've been listening to see if someone else has <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] I'm glad <now what I want> you've plucked up the courage to ring.\n",
      "[C12] Last year it was absolutely this was its first year it was perfect I had beautiful clumps of blue flowers.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm.\n",
      "[C12] And followed by the.\n",
      "[E1] Berry.\n",
      "[C12] Berries and they were magnificent. But now I let it go in the winter time because I didn't know what to do about it and now I'm wondering should I be pruning it or should I.\n",
      "[E1] When did it flower for you.\n",
      "[C12] Um.\n",
      "[E1] Autumn.\n",
      "[C12] No <E1 or spring> not theh not this year it must have been <,> uh earlier on much earlier on.\n",
      "[E1] Uh summer this year.\n",
      "[C12] Mm yes it would've been summer.\n",
      "[E1] Oh okay um what could it be uh they do flower summer and autumn <C12 mm> and then that's wh as soon as they finish flowering Dorothy that's when to prune them.\n",
      "[C12] And how how far do you <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well you can you can be as tough as you like really.\n",
      "[C12] Yes well it it looks scraggly at the moment.\n",
      "[E1] Exactly.\n",
      "[C12] And I thought now should I.\n",
      "[E1] I wouldn't prune it now <C12 oh already>. It's too late for this year <C12 mhm>. Uh and uh that's fine blue potato vine and 'n' Solanums often get straggly. Uh that's just their nature they're looking for the sun and they're straggly and leggy and.\n",
      "[C12] Well it gets plenty of sun.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah that's why it's looking for the sun it goes out and it lengthens. Uh that's the a little bit of an issue when when growing potato vines but when it stops flowering um in s autumn summer and autumn next year two-thousand-and-five then you can prune quite hard.\n",
      "[C12] And do I feed it now or.\n",
      "[E1] Um definitely feed it now spring is a wonderful time to feed Dorothy and really whatever you've got will be right for a potato vine whether it's Organic Life or Garden Gold anything for a potato vine now and that will encourage more flowers and then a really hard prune after flowering.\n",
      "[P1] Dorothy thank you for your call we do have to move on twenty-seven past seven Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] Yes Luke and Linda this morning in the Garden Clinic and we're still waiting for Mrs E Mansfield from Mt Warrigal Miss Tamara Barinov from Woollahra Miss uh Mrs Thelma Hayes from Redfern we've heard from Elizabeth Disney and Lee Zorbis so they're our final three members on the Garden Clinic please call us on one-three-hundred-seven-double-two-eight-seven-three and pick up your prize which is some Yates Pest Oil. But remember you can also contact the Garden Clinic today. The office is open today 'n' you can join the Garden Clinic uh and Linda your telephone number there.\n",
      "[E1] And <,> nine-four-eight-four-five-one-hundred thank you so much for joining us here on the Garden Clinic show uh Linda and Luke with you uh lovely to have your company on a warm Saturday love the weekend I love when it rolls around oh we can just take a load off make a nice cup of calming tea and look out to the lovely garden see how it's spruced up with the recent spring rains. I hope your garden's looking a treat let's go out to Laurie Kirrawee and see what her garden's looking like.\n",
      "[E1] Fr it's good isn't it <C13 it is>. How can how can we help what are you doing today.\n",
      "[C13] Well uh I have a Christmas bush uh at the moment it's in full white bloom. It's in a pot about oh.\n",
      "[E1] A n a New South Wales Christmas bush.\n",
      "[C13] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Yep <C13 y uh uh> not the New Zealand yep.\n",
      "[C13] <inaudible> yeah ih it's the one that turns <E1 red> red after <E1 lovely> it's in a pot about fourteen inches across <E1 right>. I want to put it out into the garden but the only problem is uh the soil is quite clay <E1 mkay>. Now can I successfully leave it in the pot <E1 yes> uh oh I'd rather I mean it's about a a metre and a half tall <E1 yeah>. A and I I would like to get it out into the garden <E1 yes of course> but I don't quite know how to go about it.\n",
      "[E1] Well let me just firstly say if you put it in the garden now it will die <E1 mhm>. The clay soil it hates clay soil.\n",
      "[C13] Oh I know.\n",
      "[E1] So you've got to um build up the soil into a mound with really good compost and soil and um uh a bit of a proportion of sand because you can see where the New South Wales Christmas bush grow they grow right along the Hawkesbury sandstone areas where the soils is quite skeletal but quite well drained.\n",
      "[C13] Yeah well it came from uh my son's garden in Frenchs Forest.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah perfect there you go <C13 yeah I'd like to know> exactly. That's the perfect spot for it Frenchs Forest the soils are so well drained there so what you've gotta do is replicate that <C13 mhm>. Mound up the soil so the water drains away. Put a lot of cow manure to m to break down that clay use Clay Breaker and GroundBreaker or gr uh GroundBreaker which breaks down the clay for you <C13 mhm>. And even if you want import a little bih uh I normally say don't import topsoil make it yourself but with really heavy clay uh import topsoil uh uh into a mound <C13 mhm> um so you've got a nice mounded garden bed plant the Christmas bush at the top and you can put other things like kangaroo paw or whatever you wish around it <inaudible>.\n",
      "[C13] Well 'cos the place where I'm going to put it uh I've had a several mm uh layers of uh sugarcane mulch <E1 mhm> over the years ih in that garden 'cos it's where I have all my bulbs as well <E1 yep>. A and uh uh like uh that can be dug in I've found that that t tended to mat a bit on top of the soil.\n",
      "[E1] It does mat <C13 mhm>. Um like any mulch does um but yes you can build that in hmhm {clears throat} um but just try and raise the garden bed as much as possible Laurie <C13 mhm> because if water collects at the root system it will rot in y'know five seconds flat.\n",
      "[C13] Yeah well I don't want to lose it <E1 mm>. Uh how long could I leave it in the pot that it's in.\n",
      "[E1] How long {break}.\n",
      "[C13] {break} it's about two year old.\n",
      "[E1] See and it's flowering well.\n",
      "[C13] Oh ih it's covered in flower.\n",
      "[E1] Wonderful well then I would probably just leave it there until the area um is at to your satisfaction <C13 mhm>. Till the soil is friable and well drained enough for you to think it's gunna grow and the water will drain away <C13 mhm>. That's that's when.\n",
      "[C13] Have I got uh t time for just another quick.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C13] Uh I have an apricot tree. I grew it from seed uh and it's about three year old. Now for the first two years it did produce fruit but this year uh I've only got about two or three <E1 mm> apricots on it. Would that be because of the drought.\n",
      "[E1] Exactly.\n",
      "[C13] Mhm.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah it's just a little s water stress like so many of the other fruit trees we're getting a lot of problems with fruit trees when they're stressed fruit trees just uh either are susceptible to a lot of insect to rot uh and disease uh and uh when uh they're water stressed particularly that's ih that's evident and they oh often don't fruit so that's all it is Laurie. If your apricot which I think is amazing that firstly you've germinated from seed and secondly that it fruited for you in the first three years is incredible let's just have a little hiatus this year and uh just feed it well at the moment y'know some fruit tree fertiliser and let's wait uh for it to fruit next year lovely to talk to you though and good to get that New South Wales Christmas bush in as soon as you can as soon as you've improved that soil. Uh let's go to Oatlands and speak with Nicky.\n",
      "[E1] How are you.\n",
      "[C14] Not too bad thank you.\n",
      "[E1] Excellent.\n",
      "[C14] Um just calling about my lawn it is buffalo it's not a huge area it's it's a really quite a large court yeahr court y'know area <E1 mhm> I suppose you could say. Uh north facing. The lawn is in great condition but we have a lot of weeds mainly binh bindy <E1 oh uhl> and and and also this other oh I it's a green on top and it's like silver underneath and I'm digging those out like there's no tomorrow but <,> yeah they just keep coming back so I just wanted y'know <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well you've got a broad leaf grass <E1 yes> which means you can't use any of the weedicides on it.\n",
      "[C14] That's r yeah that's my problem.\n",
      "[E1] But I mean having said that a buffalo's the best lawn to have anyway <C14 mm> it's so easy. And looks good most of year <C14 yes yeah>. Um so I'd definitely get some Bindii onto the bindy <C14 mhm>. Um it's a little bit late because they're actually forming um now but uh a little bit of Bindii will help <C14 yes> um and y'know all you can do really is either dig it out by hand <C14 mhm> which I always find the best way because you get the root system <C14 yes> and it's all gone and you can just y'know get your little knee pad out there take the t the radio and <C14 yeah> off you go um and you know that they're all gone and then give you a fertil um then you give your lawn a little bit of a a feed to m make it all knit into the holes again <C14 mm yes>. Uh a good healthy lawn will um be so thick that weeds find it hard to get in and.\n",
      "[C14] I have noticed that lately actually <E1 yeah> that.\n",
      "[E1] But then lately I mean goodness luh mm goodness me it's a lawn <C14 mm> it's very y'know we've got water restrictions <C14 yeah> we can't keep watering our lawns <C14 nup> y'know that's just fact um so a f if a few little weeds get in l like you've got get them out with a little wuh um hand weeder <C14 mm> or use um a specialised herbicide like uh Roundup or Zero. A.\n",
      "[C14] Yeah the only thing is have a little one who's just nearly two <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well I wouldn't use that either then <C14 yeah> uh and dogs as well I would just hand weed <C14 yeah> get out there um spend half a day get get them all out and particularly the bindi-eye with her around <E1 yes> you know you wanna get rid of that on uh as as soon as possible but un unfortunately there's no magic solution I wish there was <C14 mhm>. I wish I would sell it <laughs> <C14 inaudible> um but unfortunately I can't it's just a a matter of hand weeding getting them all out and unfortunately it's a little bit of y'know a process that will go on and on as weed seeds blow in <C14 mm yeah> from neighbours and so forth it's really hard to protect our lawn against weeds <C14 yeah>. But a healthy lawn um thick and healthy <C14 yeah> uh and uh now is the time to feed them of course <C14 mm> um really helps because if it's thick lawn the weed seeds find it hard to uh penetrate <C14 they yep> and to grow.\n",
      "[C14] Yep no that's great thanks very much for your help.\n",
      "[E1] Thank you.\n",
      "[C14] Thank you bye.\n",
      "[E1] Bye-bye.\n",
      "[P1] Thirteen to eight here at Two G B we'll take a break coming back with more of the Garden Clinic more of your calls lawn tips around the corner <,> and uh I got a couple of emails here that you might want to address I'll let you look at them during the break Linda <E1 mhm> this is Two G B.\n",
      "[E1] Well lawns are growing at a hectic pace aren't they huh hard to get um hard to get them trimmed uh my lawn is oh up to my knees <laughs> already. It's the worst um it's it's the tallest lawn in in the whole neighbourhood uh I'm sure people hate my lawn but when you are mowing and I as I am this afternoon yeah just keep it a little bit higher um with the um uh with the less rain we're getting it's important just to have a a little bit higher lawn about two inches three inches l um high uh and that will really help protect it and of course if you mulch mow um that's really important too to mulch the lawn as you go 'n' and that really helps conserve root moisture uh so just a couple of tips there when you're mowing your lawn.\n",
      "[P1] Good on you Linda let's get back to calls Maurice good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Hello Maurice.\n",
      "[C15] How are you.\n",
      "[E1] Good how are you.\n",
      "[C15] Oh not bad.\n",
      "[E1] How can I help.\n",
      "[C15] Look I've got a mango tree about fifteen years old.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C15] And two year ago I had a lot of mango <E1 mhm>. Last year I didn't have one even. But now there's a lot of flower on it do you think I should spray it with something or.\n",
      "[E1] No I think you should just leave it unfortunately now it's rained. And that's a loh uh that's a problem um when uh the weather is rainy you ih um sometimes it washes all the pollen away.\n",
      "[C15] Ah yes.\n",
      "[E1] That's the problem with m m passion fruits too if anyone's growing passion fruits <C15 yeah> because we've had the uh autumn uh sorry the October rains <C15 yeah> which month am I in October rains um you you do need to hand pollinate with a small brush f um that's the passion fruit but all I would do for you m Morrie is really just see how that mango goes I mean it's hard to pollinate a tree uh 'cos they're too tall um but yeah.\n",
      "[C15] <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Sorry w what was that.\n",
      "[C15] It's a big tree <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Big tree that's right yes and you can't really do anything to increase your production and it's unfortunately um with the season that's we have <,> sometimes it rains when the um the the mangoes are pollinating the the rain washes the pollen away so you don't get the the flowers pollinated and that turning into fruit unfortunately the the climate can be against you so we can just cross our fingers and hope that your flowers have already pollinated themselves before we got the rain from last week.\n",
      "[P1] So just leave it alone Maurice that's the uh advice from Linda let's move on then there's Robin from Londonderry.\n",
      "[E1] Hi.\n",
      "[E1] Hello.\n",
      "[C16] Linda good morning Luke how are you.\n",
      "[E1] We're good thanks.\n",
      "[C16] I'm ringing this morning about my roses <E1 yaah> my climbing roses but before I start can I just quickly say something about those beautiful white cedar trees.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C16] Which I have some in my driveway and.\n",
      "[E1] Have you.\n",
      "[C16] I have one in the house. But I was given them under the name of a cape lilac.\n",
      "[E1] Really.\n",
      "[C16] Which I thought that was lovely <E1 isn't that cute> <inaudible> flowers are so beautiful however why I'm ringing is <,> I've learned during a a course at TAFE actually that these um berries are so toxic to horses <E1 yes> they'll kill them within twenty-four hours.\n",
      "[E1] Yes that's a real problem.\n",
      "[C16] And I just thought that maybe everybody might like to know that so that if they are planting then uh luckily I didn't plant them in the horse paddock.\n",
      "[E1] Oh 'cos you're out that way.\n",
      "[C16] <inaudible> could have been disastrous.\n",
      "[E1] Horses and cattle uh they're very toxic to <C16 yes> um but you them um they're perfect for a street tree whe <laughs>.\n",
      "[C16] Oh look they're the most beautiful canopy <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] But yes that's right they are toxic.\n",
      "[C16] <inaudible> so wonderful <E1 mm>. But to get onto my roses <E1 yes> I have climbing roses on the front fence those white cherokee roses which <E1 lovely> have got terribly um <,> y'know straggly <E1 mhm> especially with the drought and y'know not having too much to to give them up there on the street but <E1 yep> I want to know um somebody said I shouldn't cut them back till after they flower and they're only just starting to look like wanting to flower now <E1 yep>. Is it right that I leave it till after they <E1 yes> flower <E1 yeah> and how far how hard can <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Oh Robyn you can be ruthless.\n",
      "[C16] Okay <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] When the kids are annoying you get out there with the secateurs and <C16 yes> take all your anger out on the climbing rose. Now the thing with climbing roses and uh I was at a wonderful garden gee it was pretty. Helen's garden um I duh guh uh landscape design consultation in Pymble last week <C16 yes> and she had this climbing rose and it was a couple of years old and it was a tangled mess and I said give me the secateurs and we untangled it we were very ruthless with it Robyn <C16 inaudible> um anything that we didn't want we removed <C16 right>. Um a lot of laterals we removed and we then um untangled these this this sort of wild mess of of stems.\n",
      "[C16] Well that's how mine have got on the <E1 and> on street line <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Right and then we just.\n",
      "[C16] Want them to be y'know cover you from the street a little bit <E1 that's r> however they get to the point where they're not <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] That's right and what you want to do after flowering is prune all those laterals back to your framework. And it's so important to uh get that frame work up and running so it looks good it's um w we had uh a some posts of the pergola we were winding them up in a sort of clockwork uh clockwise direction they just looked good in so good in in the end but that's what you need to do prune back the laterals to your framework and then you'll get wonderful new growth and new flowers next year.\n",
      "[P1] Have to leave it there Robyn thank you for your call and thanks for the warning about those bushes and the b and the and the horses very good advice. Four minutes to eight this is Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] Luke and Linda this morning um back to you callers in just a second there is an email there that um ih it's a er a problem with a swimming pool and cocos time I believe.\n",
      "[E1] It is Luke thank you very much for passing this over she has got rid of the cocos palms around her pool yay and uh she'd like some uh replacements something with a little bit of fragrance um.\n",
      "[P1] Don't you just hate cocos palms <E1 uh> I've got those four hideous ones outside they drop those y yellow berries <E1 yeah> in any wind <E1 and they hang> the pa the palms come down.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah and then their fronds hang bluh uh like dead because they don't drop the fronds.\n",
      "[P1] Why did we go through this cocos palm.\n",
      "[E1] It was some crazy nurseryman and I feel like hunting him down <P1 laughs>. But <laughs> uh from the seventies but he's probably gone now <P1 laughs> God rest his soul. But no y'know what <,> palms are quite lovely and the bangalow palm is a very pretty self cleaning palm. Stop laughing. Um m the bangalow palm it's an Australian palm and it's just beautiful they do get taller and I'm not suggesting you replace uh the cocos with bangalows but in an in a sort of a tropical setting bangalow palms do grow quite well and they're a good b uh palm for cooler climates so if you're out um out in the western suburbs and you want to create that tropical sort of a feel uh bangalow palms are definitely the one for you and in cooler weather they sort of get s a bit stunted so they don't grow as quickly. They're really lovely a s a lovely clean trunk the fronds drop off um they're not big fronds so don't worry it's not gunna hurt anyone but they drop off when they die so they're nice and clean uh and lovely uh and look after themselves. Uh okay so now let's get back Marilyn's qu query. Marilyn it just I just want to know really what height you want these things around the salt water pool. Uh you um if you wanted um taller things around the salt water pool um like a a medium sized tree then an evergreen uh native frangipani would be great uh I just don't know what height you want I mean gardenias are terrific on on a lower level the perfume of a gardenia um in a medium level like a two to three metre level the Magnolia grandiflora little gem. In a sunny spot it just flowers nonstop for ten months of the year and its big white flowers have a a lemon fragrance. Uh that's beautiful uh now uh and if you wanted something taller the native frangipanis a hymenosporum. They're flowering their little heads off at the moment. You'll see them all around Sydney they've got lemon yellow flowers they're a small to medium size tree but quite a fine looking tree not a dense tree so it won't throw a lot of shade and just p oh just a profusion of uh lemon uh flowers right now with a beautiful fragrance. Uh just lovely and a really glossy green leaf too which goes with that tropical sorta look. So I hope that helps and if you um would like to be more specific with the height I'll hih uh I'll help you even further.\n",
      "[P1] Eleven past eight let's go back to calls Anne from Blacktown good morning.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Anne for your call. To Winifred good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Hi Winifred.\n",
      "[C17] Hi thank you I'm an avid fan of the Rosses.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Thank you darling.\n",
      "[C17] I enjoy you all. Tell me uh I'm ringing for my daughter she's in Bellevue Hill and her face ow uh house is facing north <E1 yes> and the frontage is a wide long frontage and she's got two will have two wide brick spaces now in that she wishes to put shrubs smaller ones in one lot and taller in the other <E1 right>. I'm very fond of uh oh camellias and gardenias but what do you suggest.\n",
      "[E1] Well camellias and gardenias are terrific plants and in a northerly position that she has there I would love to see what sort of house she has. Uh a photo would be terrific and then I would be able to maybe suggest things that would bring out the colour of the house or would suit the <C17 oh> style of the house.\n",
      "[C17] Stone mostly.\n",
      "[E1] Stone.\n",
      "[C17] And there will be stone colour.\n",
      "[E1] And a stone colour so like that ochry colour.\n",
      "[C17] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Well y'know and uh.\n",
      "[C17] <inaudible> storeys.\n",
      "[E1] Two storeys <C17 yeah> and uh so I mean the camellias are terrific um particularly the sasanquas as you know fr Winifred would like the <C17 yeah I know> hot sun. Now um gardenias um would be good as well as long as they're not getting any of the western sun.\n",
      "[C17] No it she's facing north.\n",
      "[E1] But then accent <C17 inaudible> plants too would be great.\n",
      "[C17] Which ones.\n",
      "[E1] Accent plants plants with strappy leaves like Cordyline red sensation. These are terrific they make great statements and they give a really lovely sort of accent in the garden they really draw your attention because a good garden design should have lots of different textures and leaf shapes. That's what makes it interesting so you've got the small leaf shape of the camellias and then a really interesting strappy leaf shape of a Cordyline red sensation. Or there's a new one called pink sensation now red sensation has burgundy coloured leaves really great looking thing. Tough and hardy and I love it when I plant it with flapjacks underneath because the flapjacks have a burgundy margin to the leaf which picks it up really well and sometimes I like planting it with agaves as well so you get this really good little feel. What are you looking at me like that for you think I'm on a r tangent a raving and ranting but that's what we need to do when we're designing gardens from scratch is get into a little bit of a r rave work out what colours uh and match the colours with other things use foliage plants as well as flowering plants and then you'll have a sensational garden so I would suggest Winifred for her to look at the Cordyline red sensation for her to look at uh flapjacks uh and agaves which are those century plants wonderful statements and then maybe the hedge of Camellia sasanqua at the back.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you for your call. You shuh you you were getting worked up.\n",
      "[E1] Oh well a new garden's always exciting isn't it.\n",
      "[P1] And we've got some garden news with Rodian right <E1 mm> after this.\n",
      "[E1] Absolutely.\n",
      "[E1] Well all bush gardeners all fern lovers and all lovers of Australian plants listen up there's been a new discovery in Queensland very interesting and to tell us a little bit more about it Rodian Booker from the Garden Clinic good morning.\n",
      "[E1] I'm not too bad rolling through the morning. Tell us about what they found in and Queensland and and what that means for home gardeners.\n",
      "[E2] Well it's a um a variety of um tassel fern blue tassel fern uh Huperzia. It's a.\n",
      "[E1] A what <laughs>. A.\n",
      "[E2] Huperzia.\n",
      "[E1] Huperzia mhm.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah um <,> often sold as a hanging basket plant or other varieties of it have been makes a stunning um specimen for the shade house and under trees. But they've found one in Queensland that was last recorded in the wild about twenty-six years ago. And it was thought to be extinct.\n",
      "[E1] Unbelie and where in Queensland.\n",
      "[E2] Uh location's being kept a secret at the moment <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Oh it's a bit like the Wollemi pine.\n",
      "[E2] Very similar yeah. Yeah it's quite a significant discovery because um they've found that an extract of the plant was um useful in treating um or improving cognitive thought process. More efficiently than current supplements like ginkgo and that sort of thing.\n",
      "[E1] Good 'n' that I wuh I'd love a bit of that.\n",
      "[P1] Rodian <E2 yeah> are you <E2 inaudible> uh Rodian uh Rodian are you near another telephone. There's a bit of interference there.\n",
      "[E2] Uh no I'm not actually.\n",
      "[P1] Anyway keep going <E1 that's much better> that's bett that's better.\n",
      "[E1] Now why do they call it blue Rodian.\n",
      "[E2] Um it's got a slight glaucous uh sorta coating on the foliage. Uh and the r and the rest of the genus is quite a bright um healthy looking green.\n",
      "[E1] W oh wow so this is different to the and it's a blue tassel fern now when do they think I mean obviously a new discovery hasn't been seen for a while thought to be extinct when do they think it will be available for home gardeners. I wanna get <E2 um> me some.\n",
      "[E2] Well the um pharmaceutical benefit should ensure that the propagation gets <E1 laughs> underway as soon as possible uh and they're hoping to get it out into garden centres I'd imagine within a couple of years. But they're not a speedy plant to grow and so not the easiest to propagate so <E1 and I imagine> it could take some time.\n",
      "[E1] Extracting the pharmaceutical benefits would be hard I mean w uh would it be available in a capsule form or or uh. Is it the <E2 um> is it the foliage <E2 inaudible> that has it.\n",
      "[E2] There is one species in the genus that comes from China the plants come from sort of <,> um all over Asia and we've got nine species here including the blue one. Um the one from China is being s there's a capsule at the moment. But they've under undergoing trials to <inaudible> um our native varieties are <,> uh as beneficial.\n",
      "[E1] So more effective than than than uh ginkgo huh I need.\n",
      "[E2] <inaudible> ginkgo <E1 laughs> how do you know.\n",
      "[E1] I need to improve my memory well thank you for that it's always wonderful I think to hear of uh an Australian new discovery there's um like the the Wollemi pine we just get so excited when we know that there's things that are out there that haven't been touched and to know that it has pharmaceutical benefits like so many of the plants around the world that haven't been found we just don't know what we've got until someone goes out and finds it for us so thank you very much.\n",
      "[P1] There he goes Rodian thank you for that have a good day.\n",
      "[E1] With the blue tassel fern very interesting more potent than the ginkgo biloba good for memory I'll certainly be looking out for that one.\n",
      "[P1] Noel good morning. Noel.\n",
      "[E1] Hi Noel.\n",
      "[E1] How are you.\n",
      "[C18] Good thanks.\n",
      "[E1] That's good.\n",
      "[C18] Good Luke is it.\n",
      "[E1] It's Luke yes and how's your memory.\n",
      "[C18] <laughs> <E1 laughs> Now I've got a proper one for you.\n",
      "[E1] Oh right what.\n",
      "[C18] Now this belongs to the uh bird of paradise plant. And it's called <,> all I can find out is nickname <,> uh sexy Lynne.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs>.\n",
      "[C18] <laughs> I knew it. I knew it.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Are you serious.\n",
      "[C18] No I am that's all I can find out about it but it's a beautiful flower. I've seen it.\n",
      "[E1] Is it pink.\n",
      "[C18] Sorta p uh pink and white I think it was.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C18] It was about twelve months or so it's turned and I've been trying to find out everywhere where do you get them.\n",
      "[E1] Well d'y'know what I think it is. I think it's a h um oh duh duh duh I think it's a crab's claw a heh Heliconia.\n",
      "[C18] A what.\n",
      "[E1] A Heliconia.\n",
      "[C18] Uh now hulih.\n",
      "[E1] Hih huh lu okay Heliconia um heh uh H E L.\n",
      "[C18] H E L.\n",
      "[E1] E <C18 right> C O <,> E C O I N uh.\n",
      "[C18] Too fast for me.\n",
      "[E1] Right <inaudible> H E L E C.\n",
      "[C18] S C.\n",
      "[E1] E C.\n",

      "[C18] I A.\n",
      "[E1] I A and it's Heliconia <C18 yes> um does the l did the flower drop down.\n",
      "[C18] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Okay now the this is sexy pink is uh also it's another name I'm very happy th to know that it's called sexy Lynne <C18 laughs>. That makes me <C18 sexy pink> quite a a happy yeah sexy pink it it's also known <C18 inaudible> in the florist industry. Now a lot of florists um use it and they sell it about twenty dollars for a a a <C18 inaudible> flower stem <C18 inaudible>. It is a tropical plant Noel so it is very difficult to grow in Sydney. It I have seen it growing in gardens in Cairns and Darwin um when I do our Cairns our north uh north Queensland tropical duh tour we see it in gardens all over the shop it's a Heliconia ih very closely related as you say to the birds of paradise. Um thah ih sometimes they call them crab's claws now you can grow a couple of Heliconias in Sydney my friend Robyn has one called Heliconia rostrata which is a red flowering Heliconia crab's claw in a very hot um sunny courtyard with the western sun and reflected heat from the surrounding walls that's the sort of microclimate you need Noel to find it now you're not gunna find it for sale in Sydney you might find it for sale in mel um Brisbane. Uh so let's have a lookout and see if we've can find it we can do a little search in the nurseries in Brisbane but unfortunately uh it's a little bit too south here in Sydney to grow the Heliconia sexy Lynne or sexy pink but thanks for bringing it to our attention Noel and uh hope you have a wonderful weekend in the garden.\n",
      "[P1] One-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number straight back to calls in the Garden Clinic Nicky good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Thanks for ringing in Nicky.\n",
      "[C19] That's okay um I've got a question we laid um some sir Walter turf just before the heat wave.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C19] It was looking rather dodgy so we Seasoled it a couple of times. And then we had all the rain. And then <E1 yeah> because we'd had some sewerage pipework done in February we ended up with a trench right down the middle of our turf.\n",
      "[E1] Buh yeah.\n",
      "[C19] So we've had to repair it we repaired it yesterday but what I was wondering was should I Seasol it again uh we have got a watering permit and should I start watering it again even though we've had all that rain.\n",
      "[E1] No.\n",
      "[C19] No.\n",
      "[E1] Oh <,> yes. <laughs> <inaudible> no yes how <C19 probably> what <C19 inaudible> if y h you had to t take it out and then put it in.\n",
      "[C19] We had to roll the turf back <E1 yeah> over the trench.\n",
      "[E1] Oh yes <C19 inaudible> water water with the seaweed.\n",
      "[C19] Water so today.\n",
      "[E1] Yep <C19 yeah> even though it's rained <C19 yep> um the roots will be um will have sort of broken up a little bit and they <C19 yep> do need to uh to be repaired <C19 right> and the best way to repair roots is with the seaweed solution so just water in that strip the seaweed and get all those roots to knit back together <C19 okay>. Uh and that will happen very quickly particularly in this weather Nicky.\n",
      "[C19] Okay so um what's the difference between that Charlie Carp and the Seasol.\n",
      "[E1] Well um in well Charlie Carp's not seaweed.\n",
      "[C19] Oh isn't it <E1 it's just m>. Oh that's the fish stuff.\n",
      "[E1] It's just mushed up <laughs> Charlie carps <C19 yeah> from the rivers which is great all for all um plants really and uh the whole garden but really the seaweed is what you need <C19 okay> because that's what's g uh the vitamins and the minerals in it <C19 okay> that will help something um you sorta just get back into health after being uh shocked and <C19 uhuh> sort of m.\n",
      "[C19] Yeah it's a tonic for plants.\n",
      "[E1] That's it.\n",
      "[C19] <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] That you're a good girl <C19 I've been>. I might send you some <C19 laughs>. How about I send you some.\n",
      "[C19] Oh that'd be great.\n",
      "[E1] I'll send you some Maxicrop um to help you but how um it will take a couple of weeks to get to you Nicky <C19 oh that's okay> but um it will help in the long term and just uh y'know gyee uh water that strip in and get that to knit knit back together. Uh hold on the line we'll send you back to Daisy we'll get your uh address and we'll send you some more Maxicrop out. A good seaweed solution that one.\n",
      "[P1] Good on ya Nicky stay right there it's nineteen minutes to nine we'll take another call in just a second but it is prize time. Now earlier in the program we spoke to Rodian about something rather special. And rather secret.\n",
      "[E1] We did and it was just found in deepest darkest Queensland we don't know what <,> or we don't know ooh we do know what <,> and that's the question but we don't know where uh what was uh the little plant that has been rediscovered hasn't been seen for twenty-eight years and it has very interesting cognitive memory um uh.\n",
      "[P1] Benefits.\n",
      "[E1] Benefits.\n",
      "[P1] One th I <E1 laughs> I just I just thought I'd remind you there. One-three-hundred-s <E1 laughs>. You ih you need some one-three-hundred-seven-double that was perfect one-three-hundred-seven-double-two-eight-seven-three is the number and <E1 sighs> the first caller through has won the Munns bag it's a it's a golf course green lawn fertiliser five kilo bag.\n",
      "[E1] I tell you who needs that.\n",
      "[P1] Two organic garden booster kih five kilo bags and the pack is worth fifty dollars thanks to Munns quality garden products Australian owned since nineteen-forty-eight.\n",
      "[E1] Mark Mark Moraza needs that.\n",
      "[P1] He why.\n",
      "[E1] He just y'know he got ih he just he just arrived and he's upset at me <P1 mm>. Because I was bagging lawn lovers and saying you know just relax with the lawn he's saying you can't relax with your lawn. He's so uptight about the lawn he feeds it nearly every week <P1 I love the lawn>. He goes all of guys love their lawn so don't bag <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] And we mow it and we mow it in a pattern.\n",
      "[E1] It it oh <P1 we do> <P1 inaudible> you've got your special way of mowing have you boys.\n",
      "[P1] You have your special way you do y w your pattern and you leave us alone.\n",
      "[E1] And then he asked me why would he bother with an organic lawn food. Because he just wants a green lawn he doesn't really care and I said well y'know y you have to worry about the the waterways and our river systems and he goes I don't care and then I thought y'know what I'm gunna put it differently. 'Cos he's out on his boat and he wants to catch a fish I said well y'know what <,> if you use an organic food you'll be able c catch more fish on that lovely boat of yours and that's I think actually changed his mind.\n",
      "[P1] He has enough trouble ry not running it into rocks let alone <E1 laughs> catching fish eighte I I've been there eighteen to nine hi Anita.\n",
      "[E1] Hello.\n",
      "[C20] I have a terrible problem.\n",
      "[E1] Oh dear.\n",
      "[C20] Um I had planted my olive trees about a year ago. Yeah sorta about a year ago and they just come up beautiful had all new growth.\n",
      "[E1] Mhm. What's happened to them.\n",
      "[C20] All the new growth died off it's looks like somebody went over with it uh with a <,> weed killer <E1 oh>. All my olive trees are it's just frightening. Now.\n",
      "[E1] When was this.\n",
      "[C20] <inaudible> maybe it was that really hot day and then <E1 mm> really cold. I dunno.\n",
      "[E1] Well why don't you just give them a little tip prune.\n",
      "[C20] A tip prune.\n",
      "[E1] Tip prune a little light prune all over uh and uh it might've been that very hot day we had last week or the week before uh temperatures uh particularly out at Toongabbie oh remember how hot it was. It was like thirty-five <P1 thirty-eight-point-two> thirty-eight-point-two thank you Luke. S trust you to remember such an interesting piece of trivia yeah so uh that would've been it ol um uh I was just about to call you Olive Anita those olive trees just coming into the spring season got a little bit burnt just tip prune it water with the seaweed solution and let's geh uh encourage a little bit more growth um with those olives and you can even feed at this time too spring is a good time to feed olive trees and don't worry at all it would've just been a little response to that hot day.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you for your call sixteen to nine Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] fish markets. Lorraine good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C21] And I'm not sure quite how big it grows like where could I plant it. We get a lot of uh westerly sun.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah okay well the lilacs probably won't like the westerly sun and they really do need the the cold climate <C21 mm>. So uh um I mean suh just plant it um in a sunny spot.\n",
      "[C21] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Um perhaps uh a little bit shaded by the westerly sun it grows to about two six foot two metres tall <C21 yes> and um not a very thick tree but uh and particularly not in um around Sydney. Um but it it will grow it's m a very cold climate thing Lorraine but it will grow there's a good article on how to grow lilac in this y um this spring edition of the Garden Clinic magazine uh how to grow lilac uh which is great written by Sandra. But yeah two metres high plant it in an area that's um a little bit shaded from the westerly sun and off you go 'n' well rotted well good good soils. Nutritious soils and good drainage of course.\n",
      "[C21] Could you put it in a uh in a large pot.\n",
      "[E1] Well you could. Better in the ground.\n",
      "[C21] Better in the ground.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah 'cos it just gets too hot in a pot the the the <C21 yeah> it's the cold climate thing and the roots will get too hot and it probably won't like it so much when it's in the ground of course its roots tend to be much cooler.\n",
      "[C21] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] Thanks <C21 inaudible> for your call.\n",
      "[C21] Thank you bye.\n",
      "[E1] I just got an email from Marie. Uh and she says oh I need some help with my lemon tree it's infested with citrus gall wasp uh so yes uh have a look out for that lumpy growth everyone uh on young leaf stems and midribs uh and even the fruit stalks of citrus tree it's cau um caused by citrus uh gall wasp. Uh and most citrus are attacked but grapefruit and rough lemons are the more most susceptible and and of course Marie's got it on her lemon. You do need to remove all the stems that have that affected um w uh gall uh unsightly gall g um growing and repeated attacks can weaken the tree and then of course they're uh unproductive so remove all the galls buh um from the trees place the galls in a plastic bag seal the bag and put it in the garbage. Don't put it in the compost um because you'll just spread it all around so yes try and get on to that as soon as possible and I I would do it this weekend.\n",
      "[P1] Judy good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Hi Judy <laughs>. Where are you.\n",
      "[C22] <inaudible> sorry I had the phone on loudspeaker I was mopping the floors whilst I was waiting <E1 laughs>. Trying to make the most of my Saturday morning.\n",
      "[E1] Multitasking that's what I like in a girl.\n",
      "[C22] That's right. Um look my problem is my puppy. I adore him but <,> he's a dog that eats absolutely everything <E1 yeah>. Um he's a jack russell he destroys my camellias 'cos he loves their roots and he loves to eat them he eats the dynamic lifter <E1 oh>  even digs into the ground and eats it and he's survived it of all things. But I have bindy all though my grass and I have been hand weeding it <E1 yeah> but it just takes so long 'cos I think I have every weed <,> <E1 yeah> possible in my lawn um and it's taking so long and the one thing I can put up with everything apart from the bindi-eye.\n",
      "[E1] Yes I can too ah <C22 inaudible> again nothing really uh that is safe I would just ue uh unless you wanna s spray with Bindii and keep him off it for a a week which is <C32 inaudible> sometimes difficult but yeah probably a weekend or uh or a week um I'd say y'know five days keep him off. Uh you could use the Bindii or again.\n",
      "[C22] Would a weekend be sorry for interrupting would a weekend be sufficient <E1 mm> 'cos it means I've actually gotta board him.\n",
      "[E1] I know. Um there's no real answer for that one I mean as long as possible Judy is all I can say.\n",
      "[C22] Okay.\n",
      "[E1] Um and the yeah uh otherwise just keep with the hand weeding just keep him off as long as possible <C22 okay>. And obviously do it on a hot day if you can and as soon as possible because they're growing at a at a great rate.\n",
      "[C22] <inaudible> <E1 laughs>. 'N' can I slip in one other thing.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C22] At the moment he's actually sitting on top of my parsley and my um strawberries and my mint.\n",
      "[E1] How old is he.\n",
      "[C22] Oh he's nine months and he <E1 oh> sits on top of it and he eats my strawberries. And he eats the chives <E1 oh>. Is there anything to discourage them. Or is there anything I could plant with them that <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] No a big smack and <laughs>.\n",
      "[C22] And he's just chomped into anoth he's another beautiful <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] When I had my two puppies my two cattle dogs they got into a lot of trouble Judy <C22 okay> uh and they had big smacks on their rear ends and uh and also I had a lot of uh I did put a bamboo fencing all around my garden I made this bamboo from lengths of bamboo and I just stuck them all in it didn't have to be that high because young puppies y'know they don't really jump that m high when they're young but I did use bamboo and I fenced all my garden beds particularly my vegie patch and my herbs. And I just made a little gate I wired it all up myself it took a weekend but ih in the end it dog-proofed my garden. Uh I trained the dogs after a while and they are impeccably trained now. Uh they won't even go into the garden they won't even walk into the garden they're just such good dogs it does take a while it does take that th fen to to build the fence so they know where they're allowed and where they're not. Uh and th that's what I did and uh and then just a little smack every time they go in or a squirt with water as Dr Harry says when they're doing something naughty a little squirt with water in their face.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for your call Judy we do have to move awa uh along it's eight minutes to nine back with more calls in just a sec.\n",

      "[C23] Hi um my husband put manure down on the lawn oh about it's been down for a week <E1 mhm>. Wondering whether it's okay to mow or should you wait until the rain's finished.\n",
      "[E1] Oh well I think the rain's finished now and the rain will have taken all of that cow manure deep in to the roots so yes I would say it was fine to mow today.\n",
      "[C23] Fine to go <E1 yeah>. And could you quickly I need the garden sp the garlic spray that you use.\n",
      "[E1] Oh just a couple of cloves of garlic it's really easy Maureen a couple <C23 inaudible> of cloves of garlic all m mashed up buh with the back of a knife or something or um put some hot water in.\n",
      "[C23] Yeah I just know I guh I know what to do I just need the measurements <E1 oh>. <inaudible> you're in a hurry.\n",
      "[E1] Oh well the it's just ih there's no real measurements you can just dilute that with <C23 yes> um one to ten <C23 one to ten> ih with normal water and <C23 yeah> spr off you go.\n",
      "[C23] And soak it for the night.\n",

      "[P1] Well you've just driven in what is it like out there.\n",
      "[E1] Well it's freezing outside and I was I was I've just been in Cairns I came back last night <P1 nah> from Cairns it's thirty degrees up there so it was <inaudible> cold.\n",
      "[P1] You and Graham at a convention or something were you.\n",
      "[E1] Well yes I saw his uh I saw his signs up everywhere I was I was shoulda probably stayed back and he could just pass me the phone and I'd be back on.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah you shoulda yeah. You shoulda said here give me the phone now I'll I'll <E1 laughs> I'll do the show from Cairns. Eight minutes past nine Mark Moraza is from R P Data Property dot com dot A U. We'll tell you about a fantastic service that his business uh offers the public in just a little while. Uh big uh real estate segment in the Daily Telegraph today uh big What Is Your Home Worth segment obviously they've cottoned on to the fact that <,> people like to know what their places are worth if they're looking at buying or selling that's what we do here every Saturday morning between nine and ten.\n",
      "[E1] That's what we've been doing for the last couple of years <,> yes it'll take a very brave um forecasters <sighs>. I I think you can take their advice with a grain of salt because forecasters probably two or three years ago said that's it. The market has topped out. It's as high as we're gunna get. This is it you should sell the uh the big time diveh uh investors in the city were saying sell out of the the city sell out of the the city. Two and a half years down the track those people would have lost an awful lot of money because the price growth in the past two years has been massive. Therefore <,> forecasters right now are just saying oh look it's we're in free fall it's market's crashing 'n' so forth look I I don't believe it. There has been a an adjustment. That adjustment in certain different suburbs has been greater than others. The difficulty with statistics and and this is what I look at all the time the difficulty there is <,> at the end of the day and there's uh I think there's a highlight of the five worst suburbs of Sydney the difficulty with that is that if there's not many sales transactions <,> the statistics can look off in that if there's only half a dozen transaction low price properties <,> all of a sudden you you can say gee the the market's dropped by fifty percent in this suburb. It isn't the case. It is not the case. There's a lot of stock on the market. That's an issue. With the number of stock and a b a b a buy a supply and demand type issues. But with I thi I I don't know the numbers exactly but there's something like five thousand new people that that are living in Sydney every week. Something something the numbers are just frightening. The stock will get soaked up in a I think a short period of time and I I I think this is gunna be a few months <,> and after three or four months we'll be sort of <,> the growth rates won't be huge like we saw in the last few years but that isn't the case you can't get growth rates in thirty 'n' forty percent a year forever. It can't go like that so.\n",
      "[P1] There are some bargains out there Mark.\n",
      "[E1] There are some barg. It is a buyer's market. It's good. It's there's some bargains out there. Don't be afraid to put your hand up at auction and uh <,> if you're not the underbidder or or or you're not gunna be um <,> looking or targeting the property. Luke's <laughs> looking at me strangely <P1 laughs>. I'm just trying to get what I'm m thinking across. If you're not gunna be targeting the if want the property and you wanna buy the property. The price is X. You are at Y. You should really negotiate with the owner until such time as you're owning the property. If you gunna walk away from it and say well the market's still gunna keep on going down down 'n' down <,> I think you might be shocked and I think that it might turn around look interest rates has remain the same last week. They remain the same. Auction clearance rates have are horrendous at thirty-five percent which is terribly bad. But it's a big day in the real estate calendar this week and today is the sale of the heart the House of Hearts.\n",
      "[P1] And we'll talk about that in just a little while but it is a ve very very good cause.\n",
      "[E1] It's a very good cause yes. It's for the Westmead's ch uh Children's Hospital for their their heart foundation. Everything is being donated. The the the block of land the builders the architects the pool the gardeners and so forth. Everything has been and it's for sale today so <,> if you're uh interested in buying a a fantastic property for a good reason <,> there's a sale today at eleven o'clock in uh Kellyville and we'll go through that. We'll actually talk to one of the organisers of that earlier on this morning.\n",
      "[P1] We can a.\n",
      "[E1] But we'll get to callers which are the most important thing.\n",
      "[P1] That is the most important thing. That's why we're here. One-three-one-eight-seven-three if you'd like to register for <,> uh for Mark Moraza and Sydney Real Estate let's go to Norah Heads {Head} and Lee is on line. Soldiers Point Drive. It's a four bedroom home I believe hello Lee.\n",
      "[E1] Oh I'm very well this morning.\n",
      "[C1] That's good.\n",
      "[E1] Norah Heads {Head}.\n",
      "[C1] In Norah Head yeah.\n",
      "[E1] What d type of property have you got for us this morning.\n",
      "[C1] Well I've got four bedroom brick um two bathrooms huge rumpus room. All living reh areas upstairs with ocean views. Vaulted ceilings. Big deck.\n",
      "[E1] Now upstairs and downstairs with the views uh the living. How do you mean the living areas. That's.\n",
      "[C1] All the all the we've I've got um.\n",
      "[E1] It's like a re.\n",
      "[C1] <inaudible> open plan home.\n",
      "[E1] Okay and the <C1 um> kitchen and so forth <C1 inaudible> is upstairs.\n",
      "[C1] Yes kitchen dining and lounge are upstairs. Um all windows across the front all doors actually are overlooking the ocean.\n",
      "[E1] And the r the street that you're on the Soldiers <C1 inaudible> Point Road it is a bit of a main road isn't it.\n",
      "[C1] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Now uh does it carry much traffic during the evening and morning.\n",
      "[C1] Uh no. Through the day mainly uh traffic to the beach. 'Cos I've got the beach Soldiers Beach um two minutes down the road.\n",
      "[E1] Okay well there's um <,> uh there's a wide price range in your s in in the whole of Norah Head. There's there's the median price is four-hundred-and-sixty-thousand dollars <C1 mhm>. A property on the street that you're on sold for around about three-hundred-and-ninety-thousand dollars <C1 mhm>. Another property in the street you're on sold for nine-hundred-thousand dollars <C1 mhm>. Uh there's a property on Bald Street that sold at over a million dollars <C1 that's right>. So it's just somewhat all over the place so it's very difficult for me to give you an accurate opinion. It all comes down to view.\n",
      "[C1] Well yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Now you're just saying that you've got a uninterrupted is it mm.\n",
      "[C1] Oh only trees. I've got a um a hockey field directly across the road <E1 yes>. Um and then from there on I've only got trees that line um the beach.\n",
      "[E1] Lovely. Well <,> the median's around about four-hundred-and-sixty. I'd put it a little bit above that. It probably is gunna be in excess of half a million dollars. It could well be much more than that.\n",
      "[P1] Alright thank you for you call. Let's uh go to Seven Hills Michael is <,> in Columbia Road at Seven Hills. Hi Michael.\n",
      "[E1] Well it's lovely. It's a pleasant little street. It's very quiet. There's some sales on the street itself um. The street itself I think uh are they w uh weatherboard 'n' and fibro houses on that street.\n",
      "[C2] Nah it's mostly brick and they're they're starting to go two-storey. People are.\n",
      "[P1] Oh I <laughs>. He's he's just dropped out we'll get him can we get him back please. I'm sorry about that <E1 laughs> he he's just dropped out it was <,> uh the wrong line there. I've uh got meant to get rid of Lee m he's he's gone. So we'll go to another call. C uh we'll we'll get him back. We'll get him straight back. Cathy hello.\n",
      "[E1] I very much like those type of developments. There's <C3 inaudible> one in um St Leonards called the Forum <C3 yes> and it's above the railway station.\n",
      "[C3] That's right I know that one too.\n",
      "[E1] It's it's fa I mean great concept. You're in a a a block of units at the ground floor you've got all your shops you've got <C3 mm> absolutely brilliant transport because you get <C3 mm> to the bottom floor theh you get onto a train.\n",
      "[C3] Yeah so you like that concept.\n",
      "[E1] I love it. I think it's <C3 oh good> fantastic concept.\n",
      "[C3] Yeah I wanted your opinion. And what but what it is though the thing is um you have to pu uh we're interested in a one bedroom unit with a study <E1 yes>. And the price is um four-hundred-and-fifty- uh thousand dollars including like a courtyard. Some of them don't have courtyards they're a bit cheaper.\n",
      "[E1] Okay now what do you think the rent's gunna be.\n",
      "[C3] Wuh the uh the agent said about three-fifty.\n",
      "[E1] Okay well I would call another three or four agents and ask them the same question what they believe the rent should be <C3 right>. Not the not the agent of course that's selling it <C3 that's right>. But other agents around the place and see what the what they believe in value. Three-hundred-and-fifty th uh dollars a week rent and you how much are they asking four-sixty.\n",
      "[C3] Four y four or four-fifty anyway but.\n",
      "[E1] Four-fifty.\n",
      "[C3] Mm doesn't seem much sort of uh.\n",
      "[E1] N n 'n' not much return at all <C3 mm>. Yes <C3 mm>. Well there could be an issue with the price.\n",
      "[C3] See and another thing too you're buying off the plan. You you have to put a five-thousand dollar holding deposit <E1 yes> and they won't be ready for about three years <E1 mm>. If we don't even know what we're buying virtually. We y'know w like would they show us the picture we give five-thousand dollars deposit <E1 yes> and then um.\n",
      "[E1] Look a lotta people have done that bought off the plan and a lot of <C3 I know> lotta people have done quite well.\n",
      "[C3] Oh look don't get <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] But you can't lose five grand for three years.\n",
      "[C3] Usually I tell you what. I w I I wouldn't I <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah but the thing is you're buying at today's.\n",
      "[C3] The only trouble is I'm just a bit worried with this. The new laws that have come out.\n",
      "[E1] Don't worry about that. That's the <C3 don't worry about that oh> no no that's that's the way it is.\n",
      "[C3] Oh okay then and you s co 'cos like there's a 'cos there's a s slump in the market 'n' I I y'know I'm just a little bit worried in case it goes down down down.\n",
      "[E1] Well I think that in three years time I think we'll be outta that. Oh I think we will well and truly outta that <C3 yeah> in three years <,> count down track. The idea with buying off the plan and <C3 mm> it it will take a p a fairly brave person to be buying off the plan now and having completion soon. Well the people that have bought off the plan say for instance twelve months ago <C3 mm> and are having to complete now. They have <C3 oh yeah> they have they have issues. There's no question about that <C3 right> there are issues in that in that in that area but.\n",
      "[C3] So three years down the track you reckon it'd be safe to go ahead.\n",
      "[E1] W well I tell you what. It takes a very brave person to do forecasting and I and I don't really like doing it.\n",
      "[C3] Oh no that's right of course. I r I realise that and the market is just so up and down <inaudible> the time too.\n",
      "[E1] But it <,> historically if you wanna take figures back for the last one-hundred years or so.\n",
      "[P1] It's only ever gone up.\n",
      "[E1] It's only ever gone up by around about between eight and ten percent per year <,> year in year out. And real estate is not a short investment. It's not like stocks where you buy it today and sell <P1 mm> it in three months time. It's a medium to long term investment. So look I think it's fairly safe. I think you you might wanna go back to the developers and and try to negotiate on that price of four-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars. But uh look I I wouldn't be afraid of buying something now and then in three years time. The idea is that today's value is four-hundred-and-sixty and the price in three years time it might be five-hundred-and-twenty-thousand dollars <P1 yeah>. So you're buying at today's value and you're paying it in three years time. That's the only difference.\n",
      "[P1] Okay but get some other get some other quotes from other agents Cathy and find out what that rent should be. Eighteen minutes past nine. We'll take a break. Mike poor old Michael from Seven Hills he's back. We'll get back to him in just a moment. we'll also head out to Auburn <,> uh we cou we'll h be heading to Liverpool and St Clair. We could be coming to your neck of the cor neck of the woods. And Mark will do Around the Grounds we'll look at auctions today with Cindy Martin and we'll find out what's happening at uh w at Westmead today at Kellyville.\n",
      "[E1] Yes it's oh I think it's a lovely story the House of Hearts is up for sale today so if you're interested in buying a <,> if you wanna take your heart with you and you're interested in buying a property <,> there's one for sale here at eleven o'clock and I think it might be a good buy. It's definitely going to sell there's no question about that.\n",
      "[P1] Eighteen after nine Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] Twenty-two past nine. We'll go back to calls um and uh Michael from Seven Hills we we're sorry about that Michael you back.\n",
      "[C2] I am yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Yes okay. Michael the you you've got this th three bedroom home in Columbia Road at Seven Hills.\n",
      "[C2] I have yep. And it's a it's a they're mostly you're asking about what sorta houses they're mostly brick uh and there's quite a few going up <,> the second storey.\n",
      "[E1] Well I've got uh a wide pri a fairly wide price range. There's sales in the high threes early fours. And there's sales in the high twos <C2 yeah>. Which is <,> telling me there's s really two different styles of homes. It's fairly big homes with the four-hundreds and small little two three bedroom <,> maybe even fibro type homes at the high twos. It's <,> seems to be a very good buy. Seven Hills is only a stone's throw from Parramatta and if you're buying a property at at two-hundred-and-seventy or two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand dollars there that seems to be very very good value. The highest price in your street so far <,> is four-hundred-and-twenty-seven-thousand dollars <,> and it was achieved at the very very end of last year. So <C2 inaudible> that's the highest price. Your mum's property is it uh kitchens and bathrooms they're fairly original are they.\n",
      "[C2] Nah yeah it is actually. It needs quite a bit of bit of a reno and the other thing is I she's looking at selling it to family like I might take it over so I'm sorta looking at <E1 mhm> y'know what's what's it we what it's really worth and sort of.\n",
      "[E1] Well <C2 inaudible> I tell you what. If you wanna do it that way <,> what it's really worth is to get a valuer <C2 mm>. To come in and perhaps even more than one valuer. Perhaps two or three and get them to do a valuation draw a line through the centre and that should be the price you pay. But ih.\n",
      "[C2] <inaudible> how how would how does Seven Hills Compare to Blacktown. Does it make a big difference being in uh difference like Blacktown's obviously gone through a boom but.\n",
      "[E1] Tt wuh <C2 inaudible> Seven Hills has too. Seven Hills has too. The only thing with Seven Hills it's a little bit older. That's all <C2 yeah>. It's a little bit more original uh in Blacktown there's a lot of new developments and a lot of big brand new homes whereas Seven Hills've got still got y'know the old fibros and weatherboards <,> uh all over the place but look Seven Hills is much closer uh to Parramatta C B D than than Blacktown is.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah wuh especially this one. This is Seven Hills sort of south. In the southern end of it. Tt closer <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Well just imagine the C B D of Sydney <,> and what close to Sydney for instance Newtown. Now you gotta pay a lotta money if you wanna live in Newtown. Because it's so close to the city <C2 inaudible>. And Ultimo and so forth so <,> that's a big issue and Seven Hills is so close to Parramatta C B D <,> that that's what drives the price of Seven Hills is the proximity to the main hub centre which is Parramatta but I mean some people call that the centre of Sydney.\n",
      "[C2] But then Blacktown's just the next suburb along and <,> you know depending on how clo so it's how mu does it make it that much different.\n",
      "[E1] You're just dealing with different type properties in Blacktown you got newer and bigger homes.\n",
      "[C2] I was just thinking more like along the lines of the name like if you've got the street address Blacktown or Seven Hills just the <,> does the concept d d you know does sev does Seven Hills just have a better price because it's not because it's not Blacktown.\n",
      "[E1] Oh yes that ih that that is a that is an issue uh uh and that happens all over Sydney. It happens in in the North Shore when you when you the uh the train line cutting off from south to east. So you get um for instance like South Turramurra doesn't achieve prices as well as North Turramurra or Turramurra proper. And you're getting of course you're getting the the uh Cremornes and Cremorne Points. Ih ih if it was called Seven Hills Heights you'd probably get more money but it it's all relative <C2 yeah>. Uh.\n",
      "[C2] <inaudible> Seven Hills South which see which s <E1 yeah> to some people's mind South seems to do it <laughs>. But um.\n",
      "[E1] Look it's all relative if you <C2 yeah> you can't move the house. That's that's one point about real estate. If it's uh you you can't move the bl the block of land if <,> where it is is where it is and that's will get the price that it should achieve with the area that it's in <C2 mm>. Get a few valuers I think it's probably worth mid threes <C2 right> um but certainly.\n",
      "[C2] With other with other people going up <,> which is this sort of over the last few years there's it there is quite a f you know more and more people going up the second story <E1 yes>. Would that do a dramatic change in you know if you get say another <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Probably not.\n",
      "[C2] <inaudible> nah.\n",
      "[E1] No probably not. Uh I.\n",
      "[C2] Would it be like the hills you know like like the hills area <E1 no> <inaudible> they sort of went.\n",
      "[E1] That's right. Look I've put it at three-fifty. If you put another storey on it'd cost you probably a hundred-and-fifty that's owes you <,> uh four-hundred-and-fifty five-hundred-thousand dollars and you're not gunna get a profit outta that. You're not gunna sell it for six-hundred or seven-hundred. It's not gunna happen so <C2 inaudible> yes <C2 okay>. Answer the question neatly.\n",
      "[P1] Okay.\n",
      "[C2] Alright thanks.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks Michael thanks and thanks for being patient. Twenty-six minutes past nine here at Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] As Mark was saying earlier something wonderful is about to happen in Sydney at eleven O'clock this morning well we hope we hope this property sells at eleven O clock. We're talking about the House of Hearts. And uh on the telephone line is Gilly Paxton who is the project manager. Gilly Good morning. <,> Hello Gilly.\n",
      "[P1] Yes it sounds you're doing face painting and so forth so it's a good family day out for everybody isn't it.\n",
      "[C4] Absolutely it's a wonderful family day out and you're very kind calling me the project manager. I'm just just the person who's looking after it for the Children's Hospital at Westmead. I think all the credit this morning has to go to Landcom and Cosmopolitan Living in Integrated Design and all of the hundreds of people who donated so much time and energy and labour and materials and equipment et cetera for us to build the house in the first instance <P1 now the proceeds go>. And the noise you can hear now is the generator for the jumping castle.\n",
      "[P1] Oh fantastic the jumping castle'll be up and running the proceeds go to the Children's Hospital at Westmead the cardiology unit. It's a wonderful idea. How long has it taken to get to get from nothing to this.\n",
      "[C4] Ooh um Landcom probably first came to us with the idea oh well over eighteen months ago. Um and of course we were absolutely stoked at the notion of doing this with them. Um and Cosmopolitan Living the builders came on board very quickly as did Integrated design. In fact throughout the whole of the project we have been inundated with people saying yes I want to help I want to help. And so today is actually the culmination of all of that hard work. Um and fingers crossed and we're all very excited and it is gunna make um an enormous difference to cardiac kids at the Children's Hospital at Westmead. We're talking about children who may have a heart the size of a twenty cent piece. Um and we have surgeons who are able to operate on that. Um completely different to adult cardiac surgery. Um and we would operate on probably close to five-hundred children every year. And so what this project is doing is enabling us to do that even better.\n",
      "[P1] What's the house worth. Mark what do you think.\n",
      "[E1] Well <,> I don't wanna p uh preject pre <P1 pre-empt> pre-empt any pricing but I would suggest it's a it's a brand new home. It has the top of the line everything. It's got a pool. I think it's got five bedrooms has it Gilly.\n",
      "[C4] Yeah it sure has.\n",
      "[E1] It's got five <C4 beautiful> bedrooms. En suite. It's it's a great prope. It is brand new. It's got top of the line stuff. I wuh it wouldn't surprise me it would not surprise me at all 'n' I've looked up Kellyville 'n' the area. The the median price in Kellyville's well in the high fives early sixes. It would not surprise me if this achieved well into the six-hundreds. Uh uh. The other thing ou ih th that I wanna uh say is that <,> not only is it a good cause but there are uh there there could be some other companies out there that might even help this along some of the big ends <P1 mm> of town that might want a go. I remember the um th The Block. One of the <P1 mm> properties was sold to Crazy John <P1 mm> as a marketing ploy. But it's for a good cause so <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] This is for a much better cause than The Block.\n",
      "[E1] <inaudible> the the crazy uh the Crazy Johns out there the A G Ls the Telstras the Foxtels and Optuses. They might want to uh scramble to the telephones and see if they can ru tt rumble up some money and uh can get out there and put their uh their cards up and uh buy a great property at a good uh for a good cause.\n",
      "[P1] Okay. Now I believe that the uh the Parramatta Eels will be visiting there today <,> as you mentioned there's house there's house painting <laughs> <C4 there's face painting>. There's face painting <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> Well it is a real estate show.\n",
      "[P1] They get the they get the rollers out <both laugh> <E1 inaudible>. And just and just cover you with Solarguard <both laugh>. No there's face painting there's a sausage sizzle the Parramatta Eels are coming out the the jumping castle's out there the Kellyville rural fire service will also be there. You're there until early this afternoon. The site is Blue Bell Circuit <,> corner of Samantha Riley and Redden Drives at Kellyville. It's behind New Home World.  And uh Gilly we'll have to leave it there but I'd be ve very interested to talk to you after the auction <,> if uh that should happen before midday and find out how much it went for. Can you do that for me.\n",
      "[C4] Absolutely. It should all be over by about eleven-thirty.\n",
      "[P1] Okay l let us know <C4 inaudible> let us know as soon as you have a result will you.\n",
      "[C4] Sure course I will.\n",
      "[P1] I'll put you back to Linda su uh su uh to Daisy 'n' we'll we'll get your details. Thank you very much Gilly Paxton <,> who's been working hard along with a lot of other people to get this up and running. The House of Hearts at Kellyville. Proceeds going to the Children's Hospital at Westmead the cardiology unit. If you're after a fantastic home. Five bedrooms swimming pool landscaping it's all been donated. Looks like a terrific place. Uh it might be the home for you today. It's nine-thirty we got news with Brianna coming up this is Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] Yes good morning and welcome back to Sydney Real Estate it's twenty-one minutes to ten after ten Doc Graham with Your Health. And then Andrew Moore is hosting a very very special version of the Continuous Call Team this afternoon as we remember Chippy Frilingos. Terrible news this week we're s everyone at Two G B just shattered there's <,> not much more you can add. Twenty-one minutes to ten. His funeral will be at s uh uh at uh Saint Andrew's on uh on Monday. I believe. Let's go back to calls. Jenny is at uh Park Road at Auburn. Another house at Auburn. Good morning Jen.\n",
      "[P1] We're well.\n",
      "[C5] That's good. Um I was just wondering for some information on my house at two-hundred-and-thirty Park Road <E1 laughs> <E1 yes>. It's um.\n",
      "[E1] You've just opened yourself to a lot of phone calls from r real estate agents now Jenny.\n",
      "[C5] Oh have I.\n",
      "[E1] Yes you have. But continue on.\n",
      "[C5] Okay well I'm not actually putting it up for sale at the moment I'm just making enquiries.\n",
      "[E1] Oh good. I hope all those agents are listening to that as well.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah <laughs>. Um now I just wanted to find out it's a two-storey house.\n",
      "[E1] How many bedrooms. Has it got six bedrooms.\n",
      "[C5] Six bedrooms yes. So there's three upstairs. There's a lounge room bathroom and the three bedrooms. Uh and downstairs there's three bedrooms a lounge room sun room dow dining room back veranda <,> laundry. You know all the normal facilities. The kitchen's only relatively new and the bathroom <,> is only relatively new.\n",
      "[E1] Okay that's a lotta house sitting on I've got you down at around about just under seven-hundred square metres.\n",
      "[C5] Yep.\n",
      "[E1] Um <,> it's not a quiet street you live on is it Jenny.\n",
      "[C5] No but the house is situated back on the block of land <,> so that means that it's not right on the on the street and if you notice the other houses are a lot m more forward than ours so our house is virtually in the middle of the block.\n",
      "[E1] It is yes I can see that <C5 yeah yeah>. The theh both <C5 inaudible> th in fact both of the houses left and right're like exactly what you're saying both the houses uh are set much more forward <C5 forward> than your prohpropry {property}.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah so that does give us uh a buffer for noise and you know it's one of those things that you get used to <,> once you've lived there for a while so that's never been a um you know <E1 now> a problem.\n",
      "[E1] One of the uh. Can you remember what you paid for it back in nineteen-seventy-nine.\n",
      "[C5] Uh yes we paid <,> oh twenty.\n",
      "[E1] No you didn't you paid a little bit more.\n",
      "[C5] Thirty-four.\n",
      "[E1] Thirty-eight.\n",
      "[C5] Thirty-eight. Sorry yeah sorry.\n",
      "[E1] Isn't it fantastic as time progresses and you look back and you can say gee whizz. I mean we're looking at the prices today and say gee whizz that seven-hundred-thousand oh that's an awful lotta money <C5 I know>. We look back in another thirty years time and say gee that was cheap. I mean <C5 I know> like like this. At the time when you bought it <C5 yeah> back in nineteen-seventy-nine thirty-eight-thousand dollars was probably a lot of money.\n",
      "[C5] It was a lot of money. We thought wow how are we ever gunna pay that off <P1 laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Well I just hope all the other people out there that are s that are considering buying real estate and have said no no no this is it I'm not gunna buy it anymore. The property market's gunna crash so let's just sit back on the sidelines again <C5 yeah>. Um over time it's gunna race away from you and you won't be able to buy another property. So <,> that's a bit of a lesson for everybody <C5 yeah>. You don't don't hold back because over time this is what happens. Thirty-eight-thousand dollars in nineteen-seventy-nine and now today it's worth about six-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars.\n",
      "[C5] Six five zero.\n",
      "[E1] Yep.\n",
      "[C5] Okay. <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Across the road sold for four-hundred-and-two-thousand but it's only a three bedroom. It is a busy street. It's got a lot of accommodation. And Auburn <,> uh w when you talk about supply and demand there is a lot of demand for property in Auburn. And there is probably also a lot of demand for the type of property that has a lot of accommodation like yourself.\n",
      "[P1] So about six-fifty Mark.\n",
      "[E1] Six-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars today.\n",
      "[P1] Not bad s considering you bought it for thirty-four back in uh seventy-nine. Jen well done. Thanks for your call. To Michelle now at Sans Souci. She's Rocky Point Road. Hi Michelle.\n",
      "[E1] Morning.\n",
      "[C6] Um we've m we've bought the place in Rocky Point Road.\n",
      "[E1] And what are you doing. You've had enough and you wanna sell out.\n",
      "[C6] No no no we've just bought it actually. We moved moving from an apartment <E1 okay> we've had enough of <E1 okay>. Um it's a two three bedroom place <E1 yes>. It's um new kitchen 'n'.\n",
      "[E1] It's not a quiet street again. Rocky Point Road.\n",
      "[C6] No no. It's a noisy street.\n",
      "[E1] Yes that's okay <C6 and um>. Are you okay with the noise.\n",
      "[C6] Well it's it's not too bad it's got um <,> double glazed windows and <inaudible> <E1 oh good> shutters so <E1 oh that's okay then>. we had an inspection at six o'clock and when all the traffic was there and there was. Couldn't hear anything so it was okay.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah I've said this a few times. The the the I guess the most frustrating p uh part of the traffic is the traffic or the trucks that that drive past <,> when you're fast asleep at four o'clock in the morning you're you're dreaming nicely and all of a sudden you get shocked awake by the rumble of a truck <C6 mm> coming past. That's that's what frustrated me so much when I lived on a train line um <C6 yeah>. It was when you're in a dead sleep and all of a sudden at at at the four-thirty train to go into the city just get j shock you awake and just frustrating. But anyway <C6 mm>. Continue on.\n",
      "[C6] Okay. It.\n",
      "[E1] You've negotiated it quite well <C6 mhm>. It seems to be that it was on the market at around about s uh seven-hundred-and-thirty seven-hundred-and-forty-thousand dollars <C6 yeah that's right>. And you brought that down to closer to seven-hundred-and-twenty. What did you actually pay at the end of the day.\n",
      "[C6] Six-seventy-five.\n",
      "[E1] Wow. Six-seventy-five <C6 yep>. Great buy <C6 oh good>. Two words great buy. Yep. Fantastic <C6 wonderful>. Well done. You've you uh good negotiation. You got a good buy. Theh there's some good buys out there and I think uh this one is one of them. You you've there's some good buys out there in the real estate world at the moment <C6 mhm>. People are negotiating and their prices. This one has been negotiated quite heavily 'n' you've you've done a good job of doing that <C6 mhm>. You got a good buy and I think you'll look back over time and s and and you'll make a profit.\n",
      "[C6] Oh good. So <E1 yes> y what do you think of Sans Souci as the area in general. Like I know we're on Rocky Point Road but.\n",
      "[E1] Sans Souci's great. It's very exclusive. It's a very small suburb. That's wu uh I guess one of the advan like s like a McMahon's Point of the world. Uh <C6 mm> Sans Souci's uh o on a water type front suburb. It's a tiny little suburb which <C6 yes> quite frankly. There's hardly any properties in it and if you want to be part of Sans Souci then you've gotta buy one of the very few properties that are there <C6 yeah>. Just like McMahon's Point I think there's something like <,> I remember this fact. <inaudible> looking at data and statistics all the time. There's something like seven-hundred properties in muh McMahon's Point <C6 mhm>. That's it. And if you wanna be part of McMahon's Point then you gotta be one of those seven-hundred properties that are purchased. So <,> a a case of supply and demand. There's a lotta people that wanna live there <C6 mm>. Uh but there's only a few people that can afford it. And I think Sans Souci is a similar type suburb. Very small <,> waterfront property. It's got a really nice indeed <laughs> I'm just thinking of the geography but it's got a really nice little headland it's tucked away <C6 yeah> it's it's away from the sorta traffic and so forth <C6 yep>. Other than your property <C6 laughs>. Uh but well done. Good negotiation. Six-seventy-five. I think it's a great buy.\n",
      "[P1] Well done <C6 excellent>. Thanks Michelle.\n",
      "[C6] Bye-bye.\n",
      "[P1] Bye-bye now.\n",
      "[P1] Yeah good onya Ozinvest it's uh uh tell you what there are a lot of people investing in Queensland.  I've just come back from the Gold Coast. They are building the largest <,> um <,> residential apartment block in the southern hemisphere. It will be eighty-nine floors high. And we were we're having a look at uh a property in the Peninsula. You know that b.\n",
      "[E1] Yes I know the building.\n",
      "[P1] You know the building. We were on the fortieth floor and we looked straight across at floor thirty-eight <,> of this thing. So it's gunna be <,> it's gunna be th a a third the size again of the Peninsula which is huge. It's uh it's just amazing. Apparently it has a sway <,> it has a sway uh uh leverage of a meter. In in high winds. I mean it's just <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] Oh no that's fantastic isn't it.\n",
      "[P1] Ih ih if you think of the movie The Towering Inferno. You remember how tall that thas whi ih is <E1 yes yes>. Un unbelievable. Eighty-nine fl stories so people are obviously investing in south eastern Queensland as we thought they would. Cindy Martin is out and about today. Cindy good morning.\n",
      "[P1] We're going very well. Do you know much about this big <,> block in in uh on the.\n",
      "[C7] <inaudible> actually seen it 'n'. Well I when I say seen it I've seen all the plans and everything for it. It's uh it's gunna be massive absolutely massive.\n",
      "[E1] Well <P1 inaudible> theh theh there's gunna be another shadow on the unfortunately gunna be another shadow on the Gold Coast beaches.\n",
      "[C7] Yes I think that. A very very big shadow.\n",
      "[E1] A very big shadow which is a shame. El all the bathers are gunna have to move sideways of the shadow if they wanna get a tan.\n",
      "[C7] That's exactly right.\n",
      "[P1] But but think of the su <C7 inaudible> but su think of the sun cancer it's saving <inaudible> <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> That's a good one. That is very good Luke.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you.\n",
      "[E1] You are very quick aren't you.\n",
      "[P1] Sponsored sponsored by the Cancer Council this building.\n",
      "[E1] <laughs> That was good wasn't it.\n",
      "[P1] Okay Cindy what's happening today.\n",
      "[C7] Well I ca I shouldn't admit this. Do you know what I just did. I just turned up at an auction that's not on till next Saturday. Isn't that smart. So I think I'm on drugs today.\n",
      "[P1] No Cindy you're a bit early.\n",
      "[C7] <laughs> You said it for me. But brilliant auction it'll be great for next week so we'll do Groundhog Day next week and I'll do the uh uh talk to you from there next week.\n",
      "[P1] Are you going out to Kellyville today.\n",
      "[C7] Um no actually I'm not going out to Kellyville. I've got the other auctions on. There's um someone else from work going out to Kellyville but <,> that auction'll be fantastic. I wish I was going out to Kellyville today.\n",
      "[P1] Mark thinks it will get up into the sixes.\n",
      "[C7] I I think that's probably right. I think Mark's probably on the nose there. So <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] And I t. More importantly <C7 um> I w it'd be nice to just see some big companies go out there and do some <,> perhaps some stunt marketing and uh put their hand up for a very very good cause. I think everyone should scramble to their telephone call the boss and say can I buy a property today boss. It'll be a great marketing tool.\n",
      "[C7] I thi I think that's that's right 'n' I you know <,> goes well for for their sake 'cos a lot of people have put a lot of effort into it and uh you know it started with the idea from Landcom giving them the land and then it's just moved on from there and it's it's taken um you know it's taken a long time to put it all together 'n' I spoke to one very excited um lady from Westmead Hospital yesterday and she said she just can't believe it's all coming to uh to tail end now so. Yeah so it'll be that'll be a fantastic auction.\n",

      "[P1] Well also with Mother's Day being uh tomorrow it's a good time to look at osteoporosis and vitamin D. We're gonna talk to Dr Toomie from James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital <,> about exactly that very shortly.\n",
      "[E1] Are we. Good that should be really good.\n",
      "[P1] It will indeed so ih uh it's lots happening here today on Your Health with Doc Graham 'n' Luke Bona here at Two G B. Julie good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Morning Julie Dr Graham speaking.\n",
      "[C1] Oh how do you do um.\n",
      "[E1] I'm well.\n",
      "[C1] I'm glad uh.\n",
      "[E1] I'm glad too.\n",
      "[C1] <laughs> What about phlebitis\n",
      "[E1] What about it.\n",
      "[C1] Yeah what about it. I think I've got it.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[C1] I'm uh ih and uh you know the advice is keep your leg up.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C1] <laughs> And I said well you know it really is very difficult to be walking around with your leg in the air.\n",
      "[E1] It's not easy is it.\n",
      "[C1] I mean you could could put a flag on it 'n' something or other but it really is it's difficult.\n",
      "[E1] Well let's talk about what it is first of all. <C1 yep> It's an inflammation or an infection of the veins of your leg.\n",
      "[C1] No infection.\n",
      "[E1] Um <E1 inaudible> probably a low grade infection I would've thought.\n",
      "[C1] Oh really.\n",
      "[E1] Yep. How old are you.\n",
      "[C1] <sighs> seventy-eight.\n",
      "[E1] Don't sound seventy-eight <C1 laughs> good for you <C1 sorry>. Have you got any varicose veins.\n",
      "[C1] Uh one up the top of the the I've had both hips replaced. <E1 right> And uh this I have to tell you occurred after I broke my ankle. <E1 yes> Which was about four years ago. <E1 yes> And um the cast that they put on was <E1 yeah> too tight <E1 yes>. And the after a week m and my toes turned blue and looked like blue sausages <E1 ooh dear> um uh the cast went from the toes to the uh knee <E1 yes> <,> and uh I had it it had to be cut off because I just couldn't stand it. <E1 okay ih> And then they put another one on. <E1 yep> And for ten weeks I had the other one on <E1 yes> I reckoned it was still too tight and I ended up with two D V Ts.\n",
      "[E1] Oh goodness gracious me. <C1 and so> W the the bottom line out of all of that whether it's the cast whether it's the brah when wi.\n",
      "[C1] <inaudible> Started from.\n",
      "[E1] Whether it's the cast whether it's the broken ankle or whether it's the clot <,> is that the venous return to your heart has <C1 yep> been interfered with <C1 yep>. The other common reason <,> is varicose veins <C1 yep>. Now what happens is you do get a low grade infection or or inflammation in those veins and it's very difficult to avoid getting it. The person who told you to elevate your leg is absolutely correct and as you quite rightly point out it's very di {break} <inaudible> time. Have you got any telephone books underneath the foot of you bed.\n",
      "[C1] No.\n",
      "[E1] That's number one. <C1 right> Now the reason you put them underneath the foot of your bed <C1 lift it up> is to raise the foot of your bed and to help the venous drainage. Now <C1 right> that at least prevents the veins from becoming congested for about eight or nine hours a day and that's a great start. <C1 mm> If you don't they're congested when you get up and you don't give them a chance to get better that's the first thing.\n",
      "[C1] Well I used to put my legs against the wall at night. <E1 mm yeah but> <inaudible> before I go to sleep.\n",
      "[E1] But elevating the foot of the bed is the first thing. Number two to improve the circulation somewhat it is often wise to take some soluble aspirin if you are not on a blood thinning agent. Number three often <,> when they do get acutely inflamed they are infected and you may need some antibiotics. So there we are simple common sense things elevate the foot of your bed two telephone books soluble aspirin and occasionally antibiotics.\n",
      "[E1] Val good morning.\n",
      "[E1] How are you?\n",
      "[C2] Oh pretty good.\n",
      "[E1] That's good.\n",
      "[C2] Um I I do have trouble though um most nights <E1 yes> cramps in the legs <E1 yes>. Um sometimes it'll happen two or three times in the one night and the only relief I get is to get up and walk around. <E1 yes> Um during the day just walking around the house I don't have any problem <E1 right> but if I want to do a serious walk <E1 yes> I do develop cramps in the calves <E1 right>. But the the night cramps can be <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Night time cramps are the awful aren't they they're terrible.\n",
      "[C2] Yeah they are. It could be and and they're in various parts sometimes it's just the big toe <E1 yes> sometimes it's the underneath the arch uh sometimes in the calves um I did consult my G P who suggested uh I should have my electrolytes checked <E1 yes>. Uh and he did a full blood test <E1 yes> but everything was <E1 normal> in normal limits.\n",
      "[E1] Yep. We don't really know what causes cramps we've we used to say it was salt depletion but I don't really think that it is. We know they're very common number one in the elderly number and I guess you're not as young as you used to be none of us are. Uh number two in those people who've got varicose veins. The treatment is relatively simple <C2 mhm>. And it's good old fashioned quinine. It's been around for a long time quinine <C2 yes> um and it's n what they put in tonic water so I'm not saying that you have a gin and tonic before you got to bed <C2 laughs> <P1 inaudible>wha wha I know Luke would like to have a gin 'n' <P1 that's the way to go> um way to go <laughs> but what I am saying is ask your G P whether a little bit of quinine mightn't help the problem.\n",
      "[C2] Well I did suggest that to him <E1 yes> and he actually hadn't heard of it but somebody else had told me you know just drinking tonic water.\n",
      "[E1] Not you can't get enough quinine you've gotta drink about twenty gallons of tonic water. <C2 oh my goodness> So that's not good for a number of other reasons you won't get any sleep for another reason if you did that.\n",
      "[C2] <laughs> Right <E1 so>. The the the quinine I take it is um prescribed is it.\n",
      "[E1] Uh yes it is <C2 inaudible>. And it's called Biquinate and you you get it uh from the chemist on prescription.\n",
      "[C2] Right.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[C2] Okay thanks very <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] It works all the time. Thanks Val.\n",
      "[C2] Okay bye.\n",
      "[E1] Bye now.\n",
      "[P1] Thank you for your call it's a quarter past ten this is Two G B. It's Mother's Day tomorrow and uh a good time to look at osteoporosis looking after our bones and vitamin D. We'll do that in just a moment.\n",
      "[P1] <inaudible> minutes past and Mother's Day tomorrow.\n",
      "[E1] Indeed Mother's Day tomorrow and by definition our mothers are older than all of us and as ladies get old they amount of calcium in their bones starts to get less and less and less. On the line to talk to us about osteoporosis is Dr Jan Toomie from the James Lance medics Medicines Research Unit. Jan good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Well thanks how are you.\n",
      "[E2] Good thank you.\n",
      "[E1] What is osteoporosis.\n",
      "[E2] Well osteoporosis is simply Latin for holes in your bones.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[E2] And what it means is that usually as we age um the the normal holes in the bones which we all have otherwise we'd be too heavy to stand up <,> get bigger and bigger and bigger and the bone gradually just becomes weaker and that predisposes us to fractures with minor trauma.\n",
      "[E1] Now as we get older that happens normally doesn't it.\n",
      "[E2] It does um and unfortunately what people think is is normal is also actually uh you know brings them to be at risk of fractures.\n",
      "[E1] So is ih by definition of the of the fact that we are getting older do we all get osteoporosis.\n",
      "[E2] We don't all get osteoporosis because the the definition of osteoporosis is a certain degree of bone loss. We all lose bone as we age though.\n",
      "[E1] Right now we we know that it's quite common in women or we seem to think that you know it's a matter of course in women. Do men get osteoporosis as well.\n",
      "[E2] They do certainly do um not as much as as women but it's a a major unrecognised health problem in men.\n",
      "[P1] Doctor why is it worse with women sorry l Luke here.\n",
      "[E2] Um because women start off with uh less calcium in their bones to begin with you know they've got smaller lighter bones to begin with <,> so they can't afford to lose as much bone as men.\n",
      "[E1] Jan I would have said that women are always more trouble than men anyway but I wasn't allowed to say that on air.\n",
      "[P1] High mai high maintenance is what you were actually about to say wasn't it.\n",
      "[E1] High maintenance is exactly right. <E2 and P1 laugh> What do we do Jan about people who have osteoporosis.\n",
      "[E2] Well the first thing we need to do is make sure that their their calcium level their calcium intake is adequate <E1 yes>. And um that they're getting enough exercise.\n",
      "[E1] 'N' that's important that exercise is very important isn't it.\n",
      "[E2] That's right because exercise actually strengthens the bone <E1 mhm>. Um but we know that that's not enough in people who already um have osteoporosis. Um they need to cut down on the amount of coffee they drink because caffeine unfortunately is bad for your bones <E1 right>. Uh they should stop smoking if there aren't enough reasons to stop already <E1 yes>. And they need to cut down their alcohol intake <E1 yes>. Um and then if if they actually have osteoporosis then there are very good treatments uh available.\n",
      "[E1] What <E2 inaudible> what is the principle of treatment of osteoporosis.\n",
      "[E2] The the principle is to slow down the rate of bone loss. There are there are two types of cells in the bone and and one type builds up the bone and the other type breaks it down <E1 right> and basically you want to change the balance because when you have osteoporosis the cells that are breaking it down are working faster than the cells that are building it up.\n",
      "[P1] What about vitamin supplements.\n",
      "[E2] Um vitamin D is a useful supplement um people used to think that in Australia because we get lots of sunlight <P1 mm> and listeners might know that most of our vitamin D is is made uh with exposure to sunlight <P1 yep>. Um people used to think that it just wasn't an issue in Australia <P1 mm> but um there've been some very interesting studies which show that there're quite a significant number of Australians despite how sunny actually do have sub-optimal vitamin D levels <,> and the reason that we need vitamin D is that vitamin D is the thing that tells us to absorb calcium.\n",
      "[P1] Okay <,> we're talking with Dr Jan taoh uh Toomie who is from the James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital we're talking about osteoporosis with Mother's Day tomorrow it's a timely reminder to uh look after our bones. Dr Jan there's a caller online from Bankstown that wants to ask you a question can you take it.\n",
      "[E2] Sure.\n",
      "[P1] Okay Anne from Bankstown Dr Jan Toomie.\n",
      "[E2] Well um unfortunately no I mean what what you've found is that once the fractures have occurred <,> you can't undo that <C3 yes>. Um all you can do is try to prevent more fractures and and what you're taking is is uh just y'know it's the right thing to take <C3 mm>. Um but you're quite right about addressing the problem with younger women to try to stop the fractures occurring in the first place.\n",
      "[C3] Yes <E1 mm> well I didn't know anybody with it I didn't <E2 no> know the symptoms or anything about it.\n",
      "[E2] Well well one of the unfortunate things is that often uh there are no symptoms until you have a fracture. Just bone loss itself doesn't cause any pain. Um and so it it's something that the whole community really needs to be aware of as as a risk for all of us as we get older.\n",
      "[E1] Jan it's a really common complaint isn't it osteop.\n",
      "[E2] It is it's very common.\n",
      "[E1] And uh one thing we need to stress too is that the treatment is not immediate and I you know <E2 that's right> it takes a long time to even slow the process down doesn't it.\n",
      "[E2] It does yes you certainly can't sort of take one pill and think well that's good I've fixed it.\n",
      "[E1] All over. Jan thank you very much for your time it is important and it's relevant with Mother's Day upon us tomorrow <,> be aware of osteoporosis.\n",
      "[P1] Yep and the Mother's Day tomorrow good time to start thinking about that. Dr Jan nice to talk to you.\n",
      "[E2] And to you thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Dr Jan Toomie from the James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales it's twenty-five past ten Two G B.\n",
      "[P1] We'll take a break and we'll come back uh by the way your cue to call to go into the draw for the trip <,> for two to China includes airfares <E1 mm> to Beijing <E1 ih ih> four nights accommodation.\n",
      "[E1] Isn't there something about a yum cha brunch.\n",
      "[P1] Yes. Are you gunna come back for that on the Sunday.\n",
      "[E1] Might.\n",
      "[P1] Dude for a free feed I'm sure you will.\n",
      "[E1] Oh don't be like that I just like Chinese.\n",
      "[P1] It'll be Sunday the sixteenth of May we'll have a Chinese yum cha brunch thanks to the Golden Century restaurant here at Two G B. Your cue to call coming up between now and twelve but you must stay listening.\n",
      "[P1] <inaudible> to calls here <,> on your Your Health with Doc Graham.\n",
      "[E1] Merilyn good morning. Merilyn good morning.\n",
      "[E1] What sort of a hernia hiatus hernia <C4 uh> or inguinal hernia.\n",
      "[C4] The one near the navel.\n",
      "[E1] Umbilical hernia.\n",
      "[C4] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[C4] I had a had my gall bladder out twelve months ago and I had a got an infection after it and after having the infection operation I got the hernia <E1 oh dear>. But what I'm um concerned about this morning is that um well I've had a lot of heartburn very <E1 right> severe heartburn <E1 right>. I take Zoton <E1 right> twice a day and that's <E1 yes> what doesn't hold it when I'm having a bad day <,> I have to drink milk <E1 right>. Um and I'm having funny bowel motions the day before yesterday I had to race to the toilet <E1 right> and it was semi solid and and yellow <E1 right>. It was yellow and then this morning at four o'clock I was on the toilet <E1 mhm>  and I just had to sit and let it work it's way through <E1 I understand the principle>. But um got very severe <E1 stomach cramp> stomach and abdomuh <E1 okay> abdominal pains and I'm just hoping it's a bug.\n",
      "[E1] That sounds exactly <C4 inaudible> what it is just because you've had a hernia operation uh any sort of operation gall bladder operation hernia operation <,> doesn't mean that you can't get other things wrong with you and you still do you still get tonsillitis you still <C4 yeah> get appendicitis and you can still get gastroenteritis which sounds like what you've got.\n",
      "[C4] Nah <E1 it ih thi> and because of the operation that's stirring the my tummy up.\n",
      "[E1] No. You would have the cramps whether you had the operation or not.\n",
      "[C4] Oh right yes.\n",
      "[E1] It is due directly to the fact that you you've got some diarrhoea <C4 mm>. And whatever's causing the diarrhoea is causing the cramps. It's not related I would think to the hernia operation or the gall bladder operation <C4 inaudible> or the infection <C4 so>. It would it may be <,> if you didn't have the diarrhoea and it's always a relief to me as a medical practitioner when somebody comes in and they say I've got this funny pain in my tummy and I say you had any diarrhoea and they say oh yeah I haven't been able to get off the toilet for a week 'n' I say well beauty <C4 laughs> theh y'know that that that to me means that is more likely than not going to be the cause of your of your problem.\n",
      "[C4] Yeah well it's < E1 so> not actual diarrhoea it'd be a one off.\n",
      "[E1] Change in bowel habit no <C4 yeah> no no that's fine <C4 uh>. Wouldn't be too concerned about that and I'm sure it hasn't got anything to do with the hernia operation.\n",
      "[P1] It's ten thirty-one time for news headlines.\n",
      "[P1] You're listening to Your Health with Doc Graham it's twenty-three to eleven.\n",
      "[E1] Tom good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Yes Tom.\n",
      "[C5] Uh look I wa I'd like to talk to you about uh postrate {prostate} um problems <E1 yes>. Now I'm eighty-one years of age <E1 yes>. Uh I don't get up through the night I'm very lucky there <E1 right>. Last examination was the postrate {prostate} was quite normal <E1 right> but <.> my last blood test <E1 yes> my um P S A had doubled.\n",
      "[E1] To what.\n",
      "[C5] Oh now I that I don't know <E1 okay> but what I was wondering what is the next procedure if your P S A is up which I don't know what the level would be <E1 yes> before you have to have something else done and then I'd like to know what that is.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. L let's talk about P S As for one second. A P S A is a specific blood test which tells us the s the about your prostate. It doesn't tell us what's in your prostate but it does give us some indication of the size of your prostate <C5 I see>. The P S A is elevated in people who have got cancer of the prostate. The P S A is elevated in people who have big prostates. And the P S A is elevated in people who have infected prostates. So it's a non-specific test. The most important thing that I said in all of that was <,> people who've got cancer of the prostate have elevated P S As. Now if you've got a normal size prostate and an elevated P S A or a rising P S A if you were one of my patients I think that should be looked at.\n",
      "[C5] I see.\n",
      "[E1] What I would sugge well if you were one of my patients what I would suggest to you is that you should go and see <,> a urologist and he would do an ultrasound guided biopsy of your prostate <C5 right>. In other words he would use an ultrasound to determine exactly the size of your prostate and he would stick a needle in your prostate and look at the tissue that he withdrew underneath the microscope <C5 right>. Now that is not terribly difficult procedure although it's not terribly comfortable it's not all that uncomfortable either and it gives us some idea a good idea really w of whether you have a nasty cancer growing in your or a cancer growing in your prostate.\n",
      "[C5] I see.\n",
      "[E1] Now that's the thing that we've gotta be concerned about. Whether or not the elevation in your P S A means that you have a prostatic malignancy. And I would really sugge I'd go back to your G P and have a chat <C5 yeah> to him and say to him do you think that it's worthwhile going to see somebody about this.\n",
      "[C5] I see and they take what do they take a biopsy then do they.\n",
      "[E1] M he would send you to a urologist <C5 right> and I think he would take a biopsy yes.\n",
      "[C5] Good. And and what about infection problems like um ih is is that minimum. Like.\n",
      "[E1] After the biopsy as a result of the biopsy.\n",
      "[C5] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Um it's possible to get an infection after you've had a biopsy done yes. But not having the biopsy done because you're frightened that you might get an infection is not reasonable <C5 I see>. Because if you've got a cancer of the prostate there you want to know about it and the sooner you get it uh looked at the better <,> and believe me if I had to have a malignancy I would prefer to have a prostatic malignancy than just about anything else. Please go and speak to your G P and ask him whether he thinks that you mightn't be w better off going to see a specialist.\n",
      "[E1] Claire good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Yes who <C6 inaudible> he he w he didn't seem to have the eye hand co-ordination.\n",
      "[C6] Um.\n",
      "[E1] Couldn't ride a bike.\n",
      "[C6] <inaudible> one thing wasn't it.\n",
      "[E1] Beg your pardon.\n",
      "[C6] Well I I didn't hear all of that last week but when I came in on it it was he he had p very poor co-ordination.\n",
      "[E1] That's right <C6 yes> he he couldn't <C6 inaudible> ride a push bike they'd done everything.\n",
      "[C6] That's right now he's just so similar to my gra eight eight year old grandson <E1 right>. My daughter um a friend recommended gymnastics <E1 yes>. She has him in which he is improving he has been going to that for about six months now <E1 yes> and also another thing <,> that I'd like to share what that lady may be able to do um is take him to a occupational therapist <E1 yes>. Now that's where my grandson goes once a week she takes him out of school the occupational therapist said it's theh they have hypermobility.\n",
      "[E1] Hypermobility.\n",
      "[C6] Hypermobility yes the and the m the muscles are too flexible <E1 oh right>. Now my grandson had the same problem. He played soccer he couldn't at really play. He would skip along the soccer field <E1 right> and we used to think what's the matter with him you know he played he didn't play football he does swimming he still learns swimming <E1 right> he doesn't like putting his head in the water <E1 oh that's oh> like that lady's little grandson <E1 yeah m>. And I thought that <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] I uh I know a couple of adults who're in that boat too.\n",
      "[C6] Pardon.\n",
      "[E1] I know a couple of adults who're in that boat too <C6 oh yes yeah yes>. No names no pack drill but my wife might be listening she gunna kill me when you get home.\n",
      "[C6] Yes and also it's uh I don't know about that lady's grandson but it's affected my grandson's writing ha ha he has poor writing <E1 okay>. Um but they're working on it.\n",
      "[E1] Claire Claire that <C6 inaudible> isn't exactly the same that is not quite the same sort of story that that other lady had because there are other symptoms especially the writing. The writing would concern me <C6 mm>. And I would make sure that he has his hearing assessed <C6 yes> uh and that he possibly goes and sees a um paediatrician <,> because although that other lady ch last week said the only thing that that child couldn't do was ride a push bike.\n",
      "[C6] Oh did she as I said I didn't quite I I wasn't in on it from the beginning.\n",
      "[E1] No uh <C6 inaudible> the only thing that the only thing that he couldn't do was ride a push bike. You've got a few your grandson has a few more symptoms <,> and I would definitely make sure that his hearing's okay and d and question whether he doesn't need a referral to a paediatrician.\n",
      "[P1] Thanks for your call Claire.\n",
      "[C6] Alright thank you Doctor bye.\n",
      "[P1] Bye now <E1 b b bye-bye Claire>. Eighteen to eleven o'clock Two G B.\n",
      "[E1] Julie good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Not really um you probably have an oily skin and they are just really blocked sweat glands they're like big pimples and they're really a nuisance they're awful things.\n",
      "[C7] I know they're horrible.\n",
      "[E1] And they c do they get infected Julie.\n",
      "[C7] Quite often yes.\n",
      "[E1] How old are you.\n",
      "[C7] Oh me uh I'm fifty-two.\n",
      "[E1] Have you been checked for sugar.\n",
      "[C7] Uh I uh well a while ago yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Has anybody in your family got diabetes.\n",
      "[C7] No we haven't actually.\n",
      "[E1] Are you.\n",
      "[C7] I did I did I had <,> a test and for about a couple of months they thought I may have been I may have had diabetes but then it proved to be negative.\n",
      "[E1] Did you have the two hour sugar test the glucose tolerance test.\n",
      "[C7] No no they just took a blood test.\n",
      "[E1] Mm Julie I I would go back to your G P and and there there're a couple of issues here. Number one you you probably have an oily skin and they are blocked sweat glands so they're the sebaceous cysts. Number <C7 right> two. They can get infected and it is not uncommon once you have one infected to get a whole crop of them infected as the result of the infection itself. But number three you really should make sure that you haven't got diabetes have you any children.\n",
      "[C7] No I don't I'm single no children.\n",
      "[E1] Okay and your mother or your father didn't have diabetes.\n",
      "[C7] No no.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. It's worth while getting that checked out again. The the gold standard to determine whether you have diabetes or not is a thing called a glucose tolerance test. It's a two hour test and they take about four lots of sh uh blood from you and from that you can tell absolutely whether you have diabetes or not so here we are <,> sebaceous cysts can be quite normal recurrent infections may be because of the infection that doesn't quite go away but be careful that haven't got an underlying problem diabetes which is the cause of the whole lot.\n",
      "[P1] And your chance to win a trip for two to China coming up soon between now and midday today stay listening for your cue to call.\n",
      "[E1] Amy good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Hello Amy.\n",
      "[C8] Yes Dr Graham good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Good mor.\n",
      "[C8] Uh I had a question to the doctor the uh about osteoporosis <E1 yes>. I missed out <E1 that's alright>. I would like your advice please. Under my uh nephrologist uh instruction <,> I am not allowed to take any vitamin D no calcium nor vitamins C because I have got calculus history <,> <E1 right> my kidney <E1 right>. At the same time I have been on the Fosamax since four years now <E1 right> <,> but I'm on the Prednisone for my uh polymyalgia and Warfarin because on account of my mechanical valve <E1 right>. So I'm sort of you know I don't know what to do.\n",
      "[E1] Okay Amy I don't think I'd do anything other than what you're doing at the moment <C8 inaudible>. Now there's no doubt that the Prednisone causes ost well makes the osteoporosis far more pronounced far quick far more quickly <C8 yeah>. But the Fosamax on the other hand should to a degree counterbalance that <C8 yes yeah>. One of the things that really was said was that the treatment for osteoporosis is not quick. It is a long term treatment <C8 yes>. And you don't get magic cures it takes months and months and months and years <C8 yes> to see whether the medication that you're taking is doing any good <E8 yes>. But you are at risk. From the sound of your voice you're <,> well you won't see sixty-five again. Um would that be correct.\n",
      "[C8] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] And you're on the Prednisone which is not helping your osteoporosis but <C8 no> the Fosamax will counteract it so it's like a seesaw if you like. Um the Prednisone on one side <C8 yes> the Fosamax on the other side which one's going to be heavier which one's going to win <C8 yes>. And I don't know the answer to that question but I they are on opposite sides of the seesaw they're certainly not on same side but I wouldn't change anything I'd be going exac along exactly the same way as you have been and wait and see what happens.\n",
      "[E1] Maureen good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C9] Um I was wondering uh if you could give me some information on P M R.\n",
      "[E1] Polymyalgia rheumatica.\n",
      "[C9] That's it.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. We just talking about that.\n",
      "[C9] Yeah I was diagnosed um about fourteen months ago with it <E1 right>. Um I've been on Prednisone <E1 yes>. Um when I f was first diagnosed it was twenty-three <E1 yes>. Um I went down. I.\n",
      "[E1] This is the dose of Prednisone you're talking about.\n",
      "[C9] No my blood test was <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Oh ye yeah so right.\n",
      "[C9] Twenty-three <E1 yes>. Um I got it down to six-point-seven <E1 mm> so I started cutting down on the Prednisone <E1 Prednisone  yes>. It went up to twenty-eight <E1 yes>. I went back up on the Prednisone.\n",
      "[E1] You didn't need the blood test to tell you that it wasn't good did you.\n",
      "[C9] <laughs> No. Um it came down again to three-point-six. I cut down to one and half. The last three weeks I've been in absolute agony <E1 agony okay>. Um I rang my doc this morning 'cos I had a blood test last week it's back up to twenty-three.\n",
      "[E1] Right okay. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an auto immune disease. That means your body decides that it wants to attack itself <,> and attacks your muscles and your joints. I must confess that I have been fooled by polymyalgia rheumatica uh on three or four occasions <,> it has just an unusual presentation. It can present as aching joints it can present as aching muscles it can present as aching knees. One thing about it in its acute phase it is you are sick. When <C9 inaudible> you have polymyalgia rheumatica you look sick you feel sick you feel absolutely miserable <C9 mhm>. I think probably the hardest part about polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosing it <,> and I've certainly missed it and I make no bones about it I've missed it on a number of occasions because it isn't something that you think about. The diagnosis is usually made by well in my case anyway by a uh rheumatologist who I've sent people to <C9 mhm>. And the treatment is to reduce the inflammation <,> we don't know what makes the polymyalgia rheumatica start we don't know what makes it stop we don't know what makes it better we don't know what makes it worse but what we do know is that if you go onto Prednisone in significant doses you feel a lot better. Now I'm not a big fan of Prednisone never have been. It can.\n",
      "[C9] That's why I tried to cut down because I know the side effects from it myself and that.\n",
      "[E1] That's right <C9 'n' um>. But it can save your life <C9 mhm>. And under these circumstances uh it ih you really haven't got a lot of choice.\n",
      "[C9] There's nothing else you can <C9 there> do for it.\n",
      "[E1] There is nothing else that you can do for it but you do need to be under the care of a competent rheumatologist and I get the feeling and I'm just saying th I just get the impression <,> that those people who stay on the Prednisone a little bit longer than they should in the first instance in other words if your numbers go down to three and you feel okay and you immediately immediately go off the Prednisone uh the polymyalgia rheumatica tends to bounce back. Sometimes if you can stay on it just a little bit longer it is my impression and I say my impression I have no figures or nothing other than just a a a a G P's nose to back it up that those people don't seem to get the recurrence as quickly. But uh you do need to be under the care of a competent um rheumatologist.\n",
      "[E1] Marilyn good morning.\n",
      "[E1] We have we've got Matters 'n' Male 'n' Medical coming up so we'll balance the equation a bit later on.\n",
      "[C10] Okay um my problem is uh I went off H R T in January and I took the you know I went through the doctor you know downsizing it and everything <,> then was off it for a couple of months and then the hot flushes and the sweats all came back again <E1 yes> and everything so I've chosen to go back on it again <E1 right> so I don't know and I had been off it once before and when I took it again it more or less kicks in straight away <E1 yes> so I get rid of the hot flushes. Well I've it's uh pro uh it's probably only been a week but I'm still getting you know it hasn't doesn't feel any different. I'm just wondering how long does it take before the H R T <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Almost immediately is normally the answer to that question provided you're taking enough of it. Which H R T are you taking.\n",
      "[C10] Uh it's um <E1 the p> it's the <E1 patch> it no it's the the tablets the ravera {Provera}.\n",
      "[E1] Premarin and Provera.\n",
      "[C10] Yes yes <E1 okay> at six-point-two-five <E1 yep>. And uh five milligrams.\n",
      "[E1] Yep. You may have to increase the Premarin a l the uh Premarin a little bit but <,> go and see your G P. The uh Marilyn the only thing that I do say to you is <,> this is an informed consent decision. You realise that there is an increased incidence of breast cancer an increased incidence of uterine cancer. Make sure you have your breasts checked regularly make sure you have regular pap smears. Because it is an informed consent decision but normally it kicks in pretty well straight away it may be that you need a little bit more oestrogen.\n",
      "[P1] Welcome back to Your Health with Doc Graham the lines are open on one-three-one-eight-seven-three Two G B dot com is where you'll find us on the net but can we can please <,> yeeeh you've got to keep your emails brief Doc haven't you d um don't tell us a short story just give us it quickly because it's very very hard to write through and and wade through it all so if you can be as as brief as you can that'd be great. All m uh m Matters Male and Medical coming up in about uh fif ooh twenty-five minutes.\n",
      "[E1] About twenty-five minutes yes. Um and it very interesting uh we're gunna have a talk today with Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Um brought to us by uh Lilly Pharmaceuticals. And it really is talking about a lot of diseases that have one common symptom. Chris are you there good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Good thank you how are you.\n",
      "[C11] Yeah good thank you. Look I've actually um I think you answered some of my problems or some of my questions with the last calls <E1 right>. I've been o on Prednisone since October last year um for an on un undiagnosed muscle problem which <E1 right> which they s seem to have um y y'know problems diagnosing and I'm just worried about long term effects 'cos everyone tells me <,> that that it gives you cataracts that it gives you osteo <E1 oh no> that that it causes cancer and <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Prednisone is a wonderful drug Chris but it must be used m absolutely totally and completely properly. It can save your life but it can also kill you and therein lies its paradox. Um who dy who couldn't diagnose what was wrong with your muscles.\n",
      "[C11] Okay um uh m uh it's my G P sent me to a rheumatologist.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C11] Um and she ee he he was sending me for all tests and I went for a lotta tests like um you know bone scans and X rays and wha.\n",
      "[E1] And did he say the magic words polymyalgia rheumatica or not.\n",
      "[C11] No he he didn't he said I was too young for it like I'm I'm I I'm I'm only forty <E1 right>. And I'm pi and he said to the to that he's never heard of it in in that age um but what it is it actually started in ih ih in my thigh muscles and sorta spread up to my shoulders <E1 right>. And um and the last few days I I've been trying to cut back ih some Prednisone I actually halved the dosage myself and I can feel coming back into my shoulders <E1 okay> and and without it I've um I'm like I really do have trouble functioning. I get so stiff and <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Chris if you ca a Prednisone can be believe it or not addictive too. It was marketed in the original cuh case as an anti depressant because anybody on Prednisone feels really good <,> and then they go off it and they feel really bad. Prednisone does a couple of things to you. Number one it can increase your chances of osteoporosis. Number two <,> it can g it prevents your body from fighting infection. Number three it can put up your blood pressure. Number four it can give you liver changes it can do all sorts of things <C11 mm>. But it can save your life. What I suggest you do is this. I suggest you go back and see the specialist and you say to him Doctor have you got a diagnosis for me <,> do you think it is wise for me to stay on Prednisone for the next I don't know how long <,> um because if you haven't got a diagnosis for me then what the hell am I taking the Prednisone for. And take it from there. But <C11 okay then> it can cure you it can save your life but it can also kill you so be careful okay.\n",
      "[C11] Okay great thanks a lot there.\n",
      "[E1] Bye Chris.\n",
      "[C11] Bye-bye.\n",
      "[E1] Margaret good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[C12] Uh and.\n",
      "[E1] That's a really really that and renal colic are the two worst pains that you can have.\n",
      "[C12] Yes. Well I uh ended up I had the an abscess on the pancreas <E1 yes> and I lost half my pancreas <E1 yes> and then they had to um do a bypass <E1 yes>. In now at that stage I was sick quite a lot and couldn't keep anything down for months <E1 yes> and had bile <E1 yes> so last night I was sick again and it didn't come on till about half past twelve which was about six or seven hours  after I'd eaten <E1 right> and it was only bile that I was bringing up.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. How long ago did you have the pancreatitis and the operation.\n",
      "[C12] The la well the operation was six years ago <E1 right> but I the last attack I had was two years ago.\n",
      "[E1] Right and you've been absolutely pain free since then.\n",
      "[C12] For that yes.\n",
      "[E1] Okay.\n",
      "[C12] I actually stopped the vomiting about five o'clock this morning because I suffer with Meniere's <E1 right>. And I had some um Stemetil suppositories that <E1 right> I took to stop the vomiting this <E1 yep> morning.\n",
      "[E1] Margaret I think you've gotta approach this from a common sense point of view. Your concern is that it might be the pancreatitis coming back.\n",
      "[C12] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] And c the common things occur commonly. Now just because you've had pancreatitis and an operation on your pancreas and a bypass <,> doesn't mean that you can get a l number of other things that cause you to feel sick. The best guide is do you feel or did you feel last night like you felt two or three years ago when you had this problem before. And I guess if you really thought about it the answer is no <,> because from the sounds of things this morning it's settling down. What I would suggest that you do is in the f common sense basic principles. Don't go and gorge yourself over the weekend. Take small meals and often and try and stick to the clear fluids over the weekend a little and often <C12 right>. If the vomiting is still there on Monday morning it certainly is worth a trip back to your G P. But my my guess is that over the weekend if you just have uh Bonox or chicken broth or.\n",
      "[C12] I can't have Bonox because it's two high in salt for the Meniere's.\n",
      "[E1] Right that's fair enough um then what else can I think of just some chicken broth or my mum used to make a great chicken soup with a little bit of rice in it and just <C12 yes> the broth off that with a little bit of rice <,> nothing fatty nothing greasy and little and often so if you had <,> a cup of a cup of chicken broth and drank it over a half an hour and then a couple of hours later another one and then a couple of hours later another one <,> rather than sit down to meat and three veg and some gravy <,> and if you're still uh vomiting on Monday I'd be going straight back to your G P but my gut feeling is that common things occur commonly and it's probably just a passing viral <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Fourteen past eleven.\n",
      "[E1] Anne good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Deca Durabolin.\n",
      "[C13] Yes <E1 right> and Caltrate <E1 yes> the tablets <E1 yes>. Mum's had uh breaks in both of her arms <E1 yes> and broken ribs <E1 yes>. Now what I'd like to ask you is yesterday mum had her third injection <E1 yes>. Now our G P you can't sort of discuss things with him I don't know why but that's how things have been the last few months <E1 right>. I tried to ask him yesterday how long mum will be on the injections <E1 yes>. And as I said I couldn't get anything out of him would you be kind enough 'cos mum has naturally osteoporosis <E1 yes>. I was wondering if you would be k so kind 'n' explain to me does mum stay on the injection plus the Caltrate for life or is it only a set period of time.\n",
      "[E1] Anne can I ask you who put her on it.\n",
      "[C13] The uh the G P.\n",
      "[E1] The G P.\n",
      "[C13] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. Deca Durabolin is a hormone injection. It is designed it's called Nandrolone and it's really quite an unusual hormone it is designed to put calcium back into the bones. But does suffer from a lot of the complications that uh other hormones do in that it does put your blood pressure up and a few things like that <C13 mm>. It is however very effective ih in putting calcium back into the bones. My feeling is that she's probably going to be on that for the rest of her life. How often is she having the injections.\n",
      "[C13] Uh the once every month. The <E1 one> eighth of each month.\n",
      "[E1] The eighth of each month. I would think that she's probably going to be on it more or less for the rest of her life however what I would suggest she do is ask her G P if she could get a referral to an endocrinologist who specialises in osteoporosis <C13 mhm>. There are so many ways of treating people with osteoporosis that I believe it's always wise for somebody to hold have a guiding influence over that and as a G P yes I I can initiate treatment for osteoporosis but I'm often more comfortable if somebody who sees a lot of osteoporosis uh has a hand in the treatment even if it's just to say yes Dr Graham you're going okay I don't want to change anything.\n",
      "[C13] May I ask uh one question should you have regular blood tests with anything like this Dr Graham.\n",
      "[E1] I look I'm a great believer in doing r le regular blood tests on on everybody 'n' by regular it means different things to different people <,> but for example I like to get everybody in my patients' cholesterol checked every six to twelve months depending on whether it's been up <,> evr especially if they've got high blood pressure at least once a year I like to get their kidneys checked out and if they're diabetics I like to get their what's called haemoglobin A one C checked at least twice a year. So yes it's worthwhile getting regular blood tests done <,> it's even more worthwhile if you're on something like Deca Durabolin.\n",
      "[P1] Yes you're listening to the doc <,> Doc Graham. Until midday today then the Continuous Call Team Andrew Moore heading up th the uh the team this uh this weekend. We'll take a break this is Two G B.\n",
      "[E1] Michael good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Has this been happening has this been happening all the time Michael or it is just something new.\n",
      "[C14] Oh no it's been happening for a while. Few years I s'pose.\n",
      "[E1] Okay uh <clears throat> excuse me your nose is the reason you sneeze is you get an irritation in the mucous membrane of your nose <C14 yeah>. Now you can sneeze wuh in the Spring and the Autumn because of hay fever which is pollen actually irritating your nose <C14 yeah>. But fairly obviously you've got a sensitive nose <C14 yeah> and the change in temperature is irritating your nose <C14 inaudible>. Now I don't think that there's anything that you can do about it but equally <C14 inaudible> I don't think it's ih all that serious either.\n",
      "[C14] Nah.\n",
      "[E1] If it did become serious <,> you could reduce the sensitivity of the mucous membrane of your nose <,> by taking one of the over the counter antihistamines that are readily available such as Claritin or Telfast and <C14 yeah> they do tend to reduce the sensitivity of the mucous membrane. The <C14 inaudible> other thing that your doctor could do if it really became a problem <,> would be to give you a nose spray a cortisone-based nose spray. That <C14 yeah> that also reduces the sensitivity. Be <C14 inaudible> careful. Do not be temperted {tempted} to take stuff like Sinex which has got pseudoephedrine in it and you can become addicted to it <C14 yeah>. Not serious. Don't worry about it and the only reason you'd do something about it if it really causes you some trouble and there are a number of treatment options available.\n",
      "[C14] Yeah no it doesn't cause any major problems you know it doesn't it doesn't turn into the flu or anything <E1 nah>. I've had the flu needle and that so.\n",
      "[E1] No that's fine don't worry about it okay. Thanks Michael.\n",
      "[E1] Cathy good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Congrat con congratulations.\n",
      "[C15] Oh thank you so much.\n",
      "[E1] First one second one.\n",
      "[C15] Number two.\n",
      "[E1] Number two and what've you got at home.\n",
      "[C15] I've got a boy three <laughs>.\n",
      "[E1] A boy three.\n",
      "[C15] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] You know I have been known over the years to to be part owners in in race horses <C15 laughs> and I have a um a a boy a girl and a boy <,> and I hope this one's a girl for you <C15 laughs> because I reckon that's a king's wish <C15 laughs> and if I ever get to name a race horse again it'll be king's wish.\n",
      "[P1] King's wish. Why don't we send her some flowers.\n",
      "[E1] Gee that'd be great.\n",
      "[P1] We'll s we'll send you can we send you some flowers before you even start.\n",
      "[C15] <laughs>.\n",
      "[P1] Fresh flowers dot com dot A U. Okay when you're finished with dr Graham we'll put you back in the waiting room and uh Daisy'll look after you okay.\n",
      "[C15] Oh thank you.\n",
      "[E1] Now tell me what can I do to help.\n",
      "[C15] What I've had um last year I had this really unbelievable virus <E1 yes> um that left me sort of wuh I've been told sort of like with chronic fatigue.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[C15] But I've been fighting it off naturally.\n",
      "[E1] Right well <C15 uh> yes you're gunna get fatigued now <laughs> with this pregnancy.\n",
      "[C15] I know what so what can I do I don't I didn't wanna leave it too long so I've just persevered and my blood count's fine but my E S R's always high. <sigh> And I've seen a professor and everything.\n",
      "[E1] This is prior to falling pregnant.\n",
      "[C15] No this is just last week so would that attribute. She thinks it's a non-specific test and so <,> she doesn't know <,> if it's because of the pregnancy also but it's like forty-nine.\n",
      "[E1] That is a little bit high yes.\n",
      "[C15] Do you think.\n",
      "[E1] It's a little bit high okay. Which part of the world do you live in Cathy.\n",
      "[C15] Um si I live in Maroubra.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[C15] Yeah and <,> also I've got really bad neck and jaw pain from the virus.\n",
      "[E1] Okay let's take this in two parts.\n",
      "[C15] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] The mai how far pregnant are you how many weeks.\n",
      "[C15] I I'm only six weeks.\n",
      "[E1] Right so you're only just pregnant.\n",
      "[C15] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] The first thing you need to d and did have you had any miscarriages.\n",
      "[C15] No.\n",
      "[E1] So you had one live child this is the second time you've been pregnant.\n",
      "[C15] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. The first thing you need to do is ensure a successful outcome for this pregnancy.\n",
      "[C15] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] So irrespective of what else is going on in your life you've got sore arms you've got sore legs you've got a sore back you've got sore something or other <C15 yeah> the first priority is this pregnancy <C15 yes>. Therefore you need to go and see a competent obstetrician <C15 yeah> and say look I've got an elevated E S R <C15 yeah> uh uh nobody's quite sure of the significance of it but <C15 yeah> I am pregnant and I want a successful outcome to this pregnancy <C15 yes>. So everything else takes second place at this point in time <C15 yes> to the pregnancy <C15 yes>. And irrespective of what the reason for the elevated E S R is as long as that baby's growing well <C15 yeah> and growing healthily and is normal <C15 yeah> then everything else can be put on hold until after the pregnancy <C15 yes>. So don't try and look for multiple answers <C15 yeah> just concentrate on one thing <C15 yeah> and that is the successful outcome of this pregnancy.\n",
      "[C15] Um once you spoke about a j a person with jaw pain and and I think you send them off to <E1 they had T> a specialist or.\n",
      "[E1] They had T M J arthritis but Cathy.\n",
      "[C15] Yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Theh just just hang on half a tick. Let me just say it again <C15 yeah>. Because this is really important to get this message through <C15 yeah>. The the area that you should be concentrating on <C15 yes> is the bit between the knees and the navel <C15 laughs>. That's the baby <C15 yeah>. We're not gunna concentrate on our jaw if it's sore then we have might have to take some panadol or some disprin for it <C15 yes> but everything else goes on hold and I mean everything <C15 yes> until this baby is delivered successfully <C15 yes>. Now yes you might have a sore jaw yes you might have a sore toe yes you might have a headache but it's all secondary <C15 mm> to the progress of this pregnancy <C15 yes>. If you can sit back and say this pregnancy's going along alright and I can't find a reason for having a sore toe or a sore knee or a sore neck I'll just take something symptomatically that's not gunna hurt the baby and we'll worry about it after this baby's born.\n",
      "[P1] Okay theh good advice there I think Cathy.\n",
      "[C15] Okay thank you.\n",
      "[P1] Stay right there s 'cos I wanna send you some flowers <C15 oh thank you> w when are you <C15 inaudible> when are you due.\n",
      "[C15] Um January five.\n",
      "[P1] Oh it's a while <P1 oh> to go <P1 inaudible> it's only six weeks.\n",
      "[E1] So that means thirty uh <P1 well do you want> thirty-four weeks to go.\n",
      "[P1] Do do you want the flowers now or when you when you have the baby.\n",
      "[E1] No give them to her now <C15 laughs> don't be mean.\n",
      "[P1] I'll <,> stay there Daisy will get your details Cathy 'n' there's the advice from the doc I could I could sense that you don't have a dog and bark as well coming on there but.\n",
      "[E1] No no no <P1 we haven't had one> we haven't done that today.\n",
      "[P1] Haven't had one yet today but I can feel one coming on.\n",
      "[E1] No well only if it's appropriate.\n",
      "[P1] Only if it's appropriate.\n",
      "[E1] Yes.\n",
      "[P1] Alright then.\n",
      "[P1] Your chance to go into the draw for a trip to China coming up very soon also Matters Male and Medical we'll be talking with Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Is that correct.\n",
      "[E1] That's indeed correct.\n",
      "[P1] Okay and uh if you have any male problems that you would like to discuss we'll give you plenty of opportunity between quarter to and midday.\n",
      "[E1] We're gunna keep Dr Cherry on the line and he may well be able to an help us el answer these questions. Uh Brian good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Wide and step inside.\n",
      "[C16] What can you tell me about Laetrile there's a mate of mine uh who's uh riddled with cancer over there in Western Australia <E1 yep>. And he won't have his chemo he says no that's not on he's had a lash at that but he's uh uh having um these infusions <E1 yes> of Laetrile what do you n what can you tell me about it.\n",
      "[E1] Not a lot Brian. Laetrile's been around for a long time and it certainly doesn't form part of the mainstream treatment for cancer <C16 no>. It's supposed to have come from almonds or something like that.\n",
      "[C16] Uh the uh the kernels of the apricot.\n",
      "[E1] Apricots I'm sorry it was apricots <C16 yeah> I apologise. Um and interestingly enough uh it's it's been around for about forty years <C16 oh yeah> but um the composition of the Laetrile now is not the same as the composition of the Laetrile some years ago <C16 mhm>. Um it certainly doesn't form part of the mainstream treatment but I'll tell you one thing about somebody who's got an incurable disease. You never take away hope <C16 right>. Under any circumstances <C16 right> you don't take away hope <E1 yep>. And that's the most important thing which you can do. If he thinks that it's working it's it's working. He's opted not for mains t not to take mainstream treatment <C16 yes> support him. That's the only thing that you can do.\n",
      "[C16] Good on you mate.\n",
      "[E1] See you Brian.\n",
      "[C16] Thanks.\n",
      "[P1] Earlier this morning we were talking about the House of Hearts which was up for auction today um proceeds going to uh Westmead Children's Hospital.\n",
      "[E1] Yes indeed 'n' what was the result do we know.\n",
      "[P1] Well Gilly Paxton is one of the organisers she's there now Gilly good morning.\n",
      "[P1] Well we're very very well well. The auction was at just after eleven o'clock was did it start on time.\n",
      "[C17] Yes we did we started pretty much on time but unfortunately the house didn't sell this morning it didn't meet its reserve and so it's going to go up for sale um on Monday and so anybody who's missed out hasn't been able to have a look at it um you still have a great chance to buy this wonderful house. But for the hospital um it was very exciting because Landcom and the minister actually gave us a cheque for half a million dollars pending <E1 ooh> the sale of the house <E1 wow isn't that good> <inaudible> such good news yes.\n",
      "[E1] Isn't that good.\n",
      "[C17] So it was a wonderful morning for us um a and obviously for the lucky person who's eventually going to live in this splendid house um so <,> maybe good for them it didn't sell too.\n",
      "[P1] It didn't sell what's ih what is the reserve.\n",
      "[C17] Oh I don't I don't think I I duh I'm not sure if I'm allowed to tell you that so so I probably shouldn't.\n",
      "[P1] Oh okay <C17 I can probably>. Uh it didn't meet the reserve so <C17 no> Mark Moraza was thinking it would get six-hundred to six-fifty. It didn't make the reserve yeah well ob you you can't tell us what the reserve is so um we can only guess it's gunna go for sale for the sale now <inaudible>.\n",
      "[C17] The the the vendor's bid was five-eighty so that probably gives um people an idea of where they were looking um <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Five-eight wm ma I think Mark was probably on the money six-hundred <C17 yes> to six-fifty.\n",
      "[E1] I'd say <C17 I'd> he was on the money.\n",
      "[C17] Probably was yeah.\n",
      "[P1] Alright listen thank you for that I'm sorry it didn't sell um because that means the Westmead Children's Hospital misses out but they they will eventually get something.\n",
      "[C17] Absolutely and as I say we did we did actually get a cheque for half a million dollars today from Landcom <P1 yeah> um you know sort of ahead of the sale so we're very fortunate and the kids are very fortunate um and it's just been the best project.\n",
      "[P1] Alright Gilly thanks for that keep us informed will you.\n",
      "[C17] Thank you will do <P1 okay> bye-bye.\n",
      "[P1] Gilly Paxton oh there you go didn't sell but.\n",
      "[E1] Oh it's a funny market at the minute.\n",
      "[P1] It is indeed. <E1 believe me it's a funny market at the minute> It is indeed. It we'll take a break it's nineteen to twelve Two G B.\n",
      "[E1] Luke thanks again once again to our sponsors Lilly Pharmaceuticals we're in a position to bring to the attention of our listeners <,> the importance of one common symptom. It's possibly the clue that they need to recognise that they might be at risk of an underlying disease process. The symptom that all these disease processes have in common is erectile dysfunction. No-one talks about this problem <,> yet it's estimated that about thirty-nine percent of males <,> between the age of forty and sixty-nine have got erectile dysfunction and of those twelve percent have complete erectile dysfunction. Yet this is a problem that always happens to somebody else. Well it's my intention as best I can <,> to encourage any of my listeners who've got this problem to discuss it with their G Ps. On the line to tell us about what else might be wrong if you've got elecrectile {erectile} dysfunction <,> is Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre Dennis good morning.\n",
      "[E1] How are you.\n",
      "[E3] I'm very well and yourself.\n",
      "[E1] Very well thank you. Uh Dennis could you tell us a little bit about the Human Sexuality Centre.\n",
      "[E3] Well it's a s uh centre that we have here in Perth uh which looks at both male and female sexual dysfunction across a broad spectrum of uh sexual disorders running from <,> what you've just spoken abou that is erectile dysfunction <,> along with uh disorders of ejaculation premature ejaculation that is coming too quickly or even retarded or delayed or absent ejaculation <,> uh through to loss of libido through to uh transgender p dysphoria uh even aspects of uh gay sexuality <E1 right> and uh that is across the full spectrum of even philias uh paraphilic behaviours and fetishes and those sorts of things.\n",
      "[E1] All sorts of things.\n",
      "[E3] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Uh Dennis if there're any of our listeners out there whose neighbour's got erectile dysfunction they haven't got it themselves. Uh their neighbour's got it. What else might they be at risk of.\n",
      "[E3] Well w what you have to remember of course is that the penis is nothing more than a glorified blood vessel <E1 right>. And as a consequence of that any of the disorders that affect blood vessels will affect the penis <E1 right>. And hence if you look at the issues that are associated for example <,> uh diabetes heart disease peripheral vascular disease hypertension disorders of cholesterol excess cigarette smoking and of course a lack of exercise and uh central truncal obesity. And now we're getting down to the lifestyle issues <E1 right> which affect the blood vessels <E1 inaudible> and tha and that becomes extremely important.\n",
      "[E1] Okay heart disease <E3 mm> are you sy are you saying that somebody who has erectile dysfunction might have heart disease.\n",
      "[E3] And also the corollary that is vice versa. Anybody that's got heart disease will have a h strong probability that they're going to have erectile dysfunction <,> and in fact there are now increasing evidence in the literature that those men that have erectile dysfunction <,> it's a lead in to the fact that there's a strong probability that they may have uh sub-clinical or non s asymptomatic heart disease. So either or <,> should make you wake up and sit up and take notice and think mm perhaps I ought to be <,> much more aware of what's going in inside my body. If you think that the coronary arteries are about the same size as the cavernosal arteries which are the tiny arteries that lead into the penis <E1 right>. And if you accept the fact that there's a probability that what happens throughout the body is fairly equal then you can see that there is good reason to believe that if it's happening to the cavernosal or the coronary arteries then the opposite is almost certainly to be true.\n",
      "[E1] Tell us about syndrome X.\n",
      "[E3] Well syndrome X is also called the metabolic syndrome and it's and I'm glad you brought that up 'cos it brings into the issue those lifestyle factors that are affecting uh our community in large numbers.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[E3] It's perhaps has it's beginning in fact way back in the womb and there's some interesting work being done f for a condition for a condition called FOAD F O A D which is foetal onset of adult disease.\n",
      "[E1] What what what is syndrome X though ih ih.\n",
      "[E3] Syndrome X is is um ih is where you um have ih obesity truncal obesity you have insulin resistance you have glucose intolerance and you have hypertension and those issues uh stem from a metabolic abnormality <,> which then leads you into getting vascular disease.\n",
      "[E1] It's almost like Homer Simpson this heart the Homer Simpson look I guess.\n",
      "[E3] That's uh in fact almost down to a nutshell because what Homer's got is the male pattern baldness and he's got that central obesity <,> and the interesting thing about syndrome X is that with this central truncal obesity you get a lot of conversion of the male hormone testosterone across to oestradiol and so you get alteration in the male's pattern of hormone flux and as a consequence of that it also leads into this other condition that we won't talk about now but mention and that is the male what's so-called the male andropause so there's a linkage right across the spectrum of disorders that are affecting men of our age.\n",
      "[E1] And <,> people with s people who uh have erectile dysfunction may well have syndrome X as well.\n",
      "[E3] It's oh almost well almost certainly there can be other causes for erectile dysfunction neurogenic <E1 but> but more than uh more than most likely that will be the case Graham.\n",
      "[E1] Okay now n nobody wants to talk about this so but we're going to talk about it. If you've got erectile dysfunction how can it be treated.\n",
      "[E3] Well very successfully today I mean m most men are are and their partners in fact perhaps even more so the latter are aware of the fact that uh we have now got some very good treatments in the oral what we call the oral P D E fives. That as a group they consist of Viagra Cialis and Levitra. These are wonderful compounds that in fact affect the whole vascular system. Uh they work on improving the biochemical processes that lead to relaxation of blood vessels and lead to the relaxation of the erectile tissue and thereby help and promote erections.\n",
      "[E1] So it's it's not all over you're not six foot under and dead if you if you've uh if you've got erectile dysfunction and as a result you you find that you've got heart disease there's lots of things that we can do.\n",
      "[E3] Oh my word in fact uh y'know you can revitalise your life as long as you use this as a uh uh as a an essential warning which says oops looks like things aren't going too well I've gotta get myself back in <,> uh take stock of things and get myself back into uh order.\n",
      "[E1] Dennis we're gunna have to go for a break would you mind holding on for a moment and we're gunna ask any of our listeners out there <,> if they've got a problem they might be concerned and they might <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Or if they have a neighbour.\n",
      "[E1] Or if they've g sorry they they haven't got it themselves then that's right <E3 laughs> it's their neighbour that's got the problem <E3 inaudible>.\n",
      "[P1] Or a friend.\n",
      "[E1] Okay. Let's.\n",
      "[E3] I'm delighted to be here.\n",
      "[E1] Let's um let's ask one of our listeners who's never ever ever discussed this before in the an anonymity of the radio <E3 yep> to ring in and talk to us <E3 inaudible> because it just might save their life.\n",
      "[P1] And certainly m save a relationship it's eleven minutes to twelve <,> one-three-one-eight-seven-three if you'd like to talk to Dr Dennis Cherry and Dr Graham about this <,> very very sensitive issue and if you've been uh uh uh uh a little bit hesitant to talk about it <,> now is the time. It can be completely anonymous you can ring up for your neighbour if you like one-three-one- <,> <E1 absolutely> eight-seven-three it's eleven to twelve.\n",
      "[P1] It's eight minutes to twelve the Continuous Call Team headed by Andrew Moore this afternoon <,> after twelve o'clock today one-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number Dr Dennis Cherry is joining us the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre and uh Dr Graham and uh we'll take a call and I think we have Errol on line Errol gm good morning.\n",
      "[E1] G'day Errol.\n",
      "[C18] I'm in me mid seventies.\n",
      "[E1] Right\n",
      "[C18] Uh I had a T U R on my prostate <,> about eleven years ago.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[C18] And I found out then that it didn't work afterwards.\n",
      "[E1] Right <C18 inaudible>. What didn't w what didn't work the T U R or.\n",
      "[C18] <inaudible> get an erection <E1 right>. Couldn't substain {sustain} it you know <E1 right that's okay>. The urge is still there today even probably ten times as strong <E1 right>. Uh I have three stents in my heart and one in my aorta <E1 right>. Uh I have vascular problems in my leg.\n",
      "[E1] Right. Have you got <C18 inaudible> an have you got angina still.\n",
      "[C18] Yes I'm still being treated for angina yeah.\n",
      "[E1] Right. Dennis what can we say to Errol.\n",
      "[C18] Can I take any of these pills.\n",
      "[E3] Uh w well if he's got angina and if he's using nitrates that's the little things you slip under the tongue or the spray that you use then it would be prohibited to use the new pills that's uh Viagra Cialis and Levitra <C18 right> because they interact badly to cause a quite a significant drop in blood pressure or they can do and <C18 yeah> <inaudible> you won't know when that would be <C18 mm> so that would be out of the question.\n",
      "[C18] I've tried the needles and things <,> I've had the dopular {Doppler} x-rays and things scans <E1 right>. And they say the blood comes in and goes out the other end just as quick.\n",
      "[E3] Yes.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[C18] <inaudible> <E3 inaudible> tablets stop that.\n",
      "[E3] No d uh the problem you have is now what they venous incompetence that is <C18 yeah> the erectile tissue is so damaged it can't lock off and <C18 mhm> lock out.\n",
      "[E1] Almost like a varicose vein down there isn't it.\n",
      "[E3] That's right yeah and it's a bit like a hydraulic pump that the valve mechanism is now just so badly damaged it can't respond.\n",
      "[C18] So I g I've got no hope.\n",
      "[E3] Well the uh the the only one hope you've got is either the possibility of vacuum erection devices and or a penile implant and at your age I think uh and vascular disease <C18 yeah> <inaudible> be few surgeons that would want to look at you.\n",
      "[E1] It would <C18 that's right> it would be very very difficult one. Errol I think unfortunately <C18 mm> this is one of the situations where the options are very very very limited the only thing that I can suggest to you however is go to your cardiologist <C18 mm> and say to him Doctor I I've got this problem there is tablets that are available but am I able to take them and ask him exactly will you fall into the category that you can or can't take these tablets.\n",
      "[P1] Errol thanks for your call Pamela good morning.\n",
      "[E1] Pamela yes good morning Pamela.\n",
      "[E1] Good morning.\n",
      "[C19] How are you.\n",
      "[E1] I'm well thanks how are you. You got two doctors to talk to you today.\n",
      "[C19] Aren't I lucky.\n",
      "[E1] Yeah.\n",
      "[C19] <laughs> Well I'm ringing on behalf of my husband 'n' he's not here at the moment.\n",
      "[E1] Right.\n",
      "[C19] Uh he's sixty years of age <E1 yes> and uh <,> uh he's uh <sighs>.\n",
      "[E1] Pamela <C19 yes> just just hang on one sec. Look number one it's very brave of you to ring because it's obviously a difficult thing for you to do.\n",
      "[C19] It is.\n",
      "[E1] Number two <,> this precisely why we k having this segment because nobody damn well wants to talk about it. And it's a problem not only for the men <,> it can be a problem for the women too.\n",
      "[C19] Oh yes of course I do realise that.\n",
      "[E1] So let's get it just pretend that there's nobody else and there isn't anybody else there's you and myself and Dr Cherry so just spit it out.\n",
      "[C19] Alright yes um <,> he's been there's been difficulty in getting an erection for the we've been married twenty years for for eighteen years now <E1 yes>. Uh he is on Warfarin <E1 yes>. He's got very bad vascular veins he has has had a couple of ulcers on the veins as well but <E1 right> that's been cleared.\n",
      "[E1] Right they're probably venous ulcers right.\n",
      "[C19] Yes he's had uh uh the lump uh but the then the theh then he was put on Warfarin about eight nine years ago <E1 inaudible> <E1 okay>. But before before that he's always had a problem with an erection his <,> his testicles are very small <E1 right> and uh I just um. He <E1 inaudible> finds it difficult to talk about but because <inaudible>.\n",
      "[E1] Absolutely most men do find it very difficult to talk about it.\n",
      "[C19] And and I am just you know just yearning.\n",
      "[E1] At your wits yeah at your wits end Dennis what advice would you give Pamela.\n",
      "[E3] Well certainly he needs a very thorough investigation there if if the comment she made about the small testicles is true we know that men who have poor testosterone production have a very ih testosterone's extremely important in maintaining the health of the erectile tissue <C19 mm>. So without that he would certainly be going downhill. Second thing <C19 uh> is that if he's got venous disease <,> uh and it's venous vascular disease then there may well be some arterial component as well <C19 mm>. So he needs a very he needs to see I mean the point you made Graham is very true he needs to see a doctor he needs to be worked up thoroughly <C19 mm> uh and as a consequence of that a real proper assessment made as to why he hasn't got erectile dysfunction I I wouldn't be surprised by now that there's a rather intense psychogenic component.\n",

      "[E1] No that's neither here nor there and you've gotta go with him and you say <E3 mm> why don't you tell the doctor what's going on. I heard this program on Two G B that said you might be at risk of diabetes you might be at risk of heart disease. Tell him what's going on <,> and maybe he can help you and really <,> maybe he can help both of you. Pamela look thank you very much for calling in <,> Dennis I'm sorry we've run out of time.

      "[C1] Good how are you I'm a first-time caller so I'm a bit nervous.\n",
      "[P2] Bit nervous oh you don't need to be <C1 uh>. What's your question doll.\n",
      "[C1] Um I'm <inaudible> my love life uh well uh I'm in relationship at the <,> I'm in a relationship at the moment I just need to know where it's going how it's going.\n",
      "[P2] Okay well the number that you're in <,> cyclewise is the number three <C1 yep>. Uh I beg your pardon it's the number nine. Uh you add the numbers s thr thirteen plus eight which gives you a three and then you add six for the year two-thousand-and-four so I'm just letting all the rest of the listeners out there know how they can work out their numbers so they can participate in some of the readings as well. Okay so you're in a number nine which is not the best time <,> uh to start relationships 'cos usually it's an ending time. But not everything will end in a number nine cycle it's just if you're moving in the same directions you're making the same decisions or you're planning together for the future then of course you go through it together <C2 inaudible>. And I feel <C1 coughs> really at the moment <,> this month of September will make or break your relationship and you seem to be making some decisions around that in this this month that we're in at the moment. There's fresh new starts for you there in October you've got some good news coming your way in October and in December you've got nothing but socially having uh wonderful times meeting lots and lots of new people so I'm sort of basically seeing here that the relationship there will make you'll know where it stands towards the end of this month. Whether you you're going to it's going to get stronger or it's sorta going to start to to y'know fizzle off <C1 yep> so that would be a time there but you've certainly got three good months coming up.\n",
      "[C1] Okay.\n",

Okay and we're talking with Anna.\n",
      "[P2] I'm really well thanks yourself.\n",
      "[C4] Good.\n",
      "[P2] That's good.\n",
      "[C4] Um you got a great show there I listen to you nearly every Sunday.\n",
      "[P2] Oh thanks.\n",
      "[C4] Um I was just wondering what's happening with my um social or love life or if I'm gunna have one or if I'm not gunna have one <C4 and P2 laugh>.\n",
      "[P2] Okay. Alright. Y you yourself there at the moment are at a time in your life now have a look at this have you got a paper and pen.\n",
      "[C4] No I haven't.\n",
      "[P2] Alright well can you remember.\n",
      "[C4] Oh yeah I suppose so.\n",
      "[P2] Okay well your A initial's a number one in numerology.\n",
      "[C4] Yes.\n",
      "[P2] And then you're you're born with the number one.\n",
      "[C4] Mhm.\n",
      "[P2] Which is your number one day number <P2 yes>. And if you add day and month together one and nine's ten.\n",
      "[C4] Mhm.\n",
      "[P2] Plus seven uh plus six for two-thousand-and-four you're in a number seven cycle <C4 uhuh>. Okay now a number seven cycle with your particular one initial which you're an independent girl like you don't sort of like to you wouldn't pick the phone up and say oh what's going on you don't like people to sort of think that that you've got nothing happening or you don't like to <C4 laughs> burden y y you're not a pushy person that way if you know what I mean <C4 okay> to sort of go and do things. Uh I feel in this particular time you're reassessing a lot of priorities in your life. You're looking at what's missing in your life <,> and I feel <,> relationshipwise for you <,> there's going to be a commitment or a very strong s uh relationship that you'll make some major decisions. I feel after Christmas I don't sorta see anything <,> a bit of turbulence before Christmas but after Christmas you've got a smoother run especially that period around August is really lucky for you because you're picking up this double eight whammy in the month of August of next year <C4 uhuh>. And that'd be really positive. August September onwards but we've just got like a little I guess you'd call a little black spot there at the moment.\n",
      "[C4] A sleepy time.\n",
      "[P2] Yeah it's sort of like hey Anna we wanna stop you. We want to stop you and take a long hard look at your life and where you want it to go it's like a major turning point major change of direction. It's a time that you feel like you're taking ten steps forward but you're taking twelve steps back. You're feeling vulnerable you don't really feel like if something you've you've got this it's like you're not full uh you're not a a complete I guess that would more be the word. And this is all starting to sort of like your intuition's really strong it's a spiritual time. It's sort of like your il oh I guess one word I would use is like an awakening so all the experiences that are going to start to happen probably already have started to happen <,> between now and the end of the year are sort of saying oh okay y'know lookih making you I guess make s the necessary changes so that the right relationships or people in your life what you want to take forward will go forward with you and what you sort of wanna l leave behind will leave behind it's sorta like there's all this.\n",
      "[C4] Oh so you're you're saying I'm analysing the type of person that I'd like to be with I'm thinking about it.\n",
      "[P2] Well not so much it's like w you're reassessing priorities. And it's just a time that when you have this number seven it's sorta like a time you specialise in some sort of field or you sort of look at who's ih the two words let go of anything like emotional baggage clutter it's sorta like you're making some endings and you're making a lot of changes within yourself.  You're changing as a person so that you're going to start to attract and we're not just talking about love life as such <C4 mhm> we're talking about the whole of your life as in friends there's new friends there's different people you're you're doing a course you you've got this {break} <inaudible> and I feel uh as you change you're going to attract some really really wonderful friends and love life is really going to really look really good. So don't sort of think to yourself oh I've gotta wait till August of next year that's not the case at all 'cos you know yourself.\n",
      "[C4] Start working now.\n",
      "[P2] No but it's just basically it's not like you gotta wait till August of next year that would be a time ih these things take time to sorta sell it whatever. But by that time even before that time but that would be my prediction would be a really really wonderful time for you in your life which you'll really be happy.\n",
      "[C4] Oh excellent.\n",
      "[P2] Absolutely and what you wanna do is some little s y'know do your little feng shui that we talk about all the time all the little tips. With spring coming up it's also time to sorta get the gardens going <C4 mhm> and when you walk into a garden or a balcony <,> uh you want to like when you enter the yard the very very far right corner of the yard put something there that's maybe a pink tree y'know a pinky bushy thing uh something pink something red. Something red and white in that area roses <C4 mm> anything like listen to Jennifer Stackhouse for the gardening show and get some tips that things that'll grow in Spring or the gardening shop but but that sort of area there 'n' on your balcony as well. You've got the card also of the judgement which is the soul searching making ih really makes sense in altogether with your seven cycles so I think it's really quite an interesting time ahead and I think that you'll really grow as a person and and really like what you see.\n",
      "[C4] Yeah 'cos I've got a quite a few things happening with the sale of the house and it hasn't coh quite gone through yet and there's a lot of things happening.\n",
      "[P2] Exactly it's that these are all the changes taking place so that all of this positive energies all that it's sorta like you're letting go and moving on. That's all looking really good.\n",
      "[C4] Oh great.\n",
      "[P2] And thank for calling through.\n",
      "[C4] Thank you very very much.\n",
      "[P2] And have a lovely night.\n",
      "[P2] Okay and of course we've goh we're talking now with Joseph.\n",
      "[P2] I'm really well Joseph yourself.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah look really good look I love the show it makes for a great Saturday night so I'm just listening to those happy uh people at the start of the show makes for a great night I think.\n",
      "[P2] I think so it sets the tone doesn't it.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah it does.\n",
      "[P2] Mm.\n",
      "[C5] Now look mine's a really specific question. It's around finances trying to sell a house at the moment. Have been unsuccessful in doing that but um y'know still positive about trying to get rid of it so sort of just wanna see what you see for it.\n",
      "[P2] But is this your birth date here the seventh of the seventh seventy-one.\n",
      "[C5] It is.\n",
      "[P2] Have a go at all the sevens.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah.\n",
      "[P2] Unbelievable.\n",
      "[C5] Yeah it's a.\n",
      "[P2] If if your anyone that has more than two numbers like say you have uh you've got for thih ih for sake here there's three sevens <C5 yeah>. Right. You're an expert on human nature with those sevens 'n' you got the three sevens. You are really really intuitive. And you would actually also have really good healing energy and even if you weren't using your hands what would actually happen you could sorta it's sometimes it's like just with your words with people to put them you've got a way of of convincing people to put them like they say they've lost the track <,> to turn their way of thought around and put them back on the on the right track and <C5 oh okay> k it's a real gift <C5 okay>. You haven't noticed that with people.\n",
      "[C5] Oh oh I probably don't notice it but y'know probably people around me would probably notice it maybe <P2 oh okay>. I definitely don't notice it.\n",
      "[P2] Absoluh well you you look at those numbers there there's seven there's seven and seven it's incredible.\n",
      "[C5] Oh okay.\n",
      "[P2] Mm. Now with the cycle there you've got that is a fourteen's a five and a six is an eleven cycle. Yeah see the eleven cycle. Okay it's it's interesting it can be really really wonderful for some people and then on the other hand it can be really really slow it's like one of those cycles that just takes forever for <C5 laughs> things to take place <C5 oh okay>. And especially 'cos I know when I went through an eleven cycle I sort of uh while back and you think about selling at that time and and it's sorta like partial I guess the two words I would use is partial success <C4 oh okay>. And once you head towards that three cycle which you're coming up to next year it just like you would put the house on the market in a three cycle and it would hih sell a lot quicker than it would in a two cycle if you know what I mean.\n",
      "[C5] Oh okay when's my three cycle start then.\n",
      "[P2] It starts next July.\n",
      "[C5] Oh okay.\n",
      "[P2] But that whole year starts the tone it sets the tones. That doesn't mean that it's not going to sell on a two it's just that things sort of take it's a slow approach it's a it's <C5 okay> it's everything takes forever.\n",
      "[C5] So maybe I need to be patient 'n'.\n",
      "[P2] Be p exactly <C5 okay> be patient. Alright. Now you've got that there so it's definitely going to take place 'cos a change of residence and everything's there for you for next year which is two-thousand-and-five if not before. Now two-thousand-and-five for you is going to be absolutely brilliant for you to do with finances. And that's your question on finances.\n",
      "[C5] Okay.\n",
      "[P2] And it you'll find because you'll pick that number three up and that number three will work very well with your J initial. The combination's quite good and you'll find yourself also with that number seven that when you're actually in a seven cycle further down the track when you'll have pick up four s your three sevens plus you'll have the seven cycle which is say four years off that your ih your intuition will just you'll walk down the street and just get vibes about things it's just all going to develop between now and the next four years stronger than ever. And I would write the word sold on any advertisements for the property <C5 yep>. And I also would put yourself at the front 'n' the back door steps and a jade plant or a succulents plant. And make sure there's no clutter around because it's definitely going to be all happening for you it's just be a little patient in this particular time.\n",
      "[C5] Okay <P2 mm> okay that all sounds wonderful.\n",
      "[P2] And listen I'll tell you what we've got for you. We're got a w a s now how do we say this. A five System Seven Oz Lotto entry.\n",
      "[P1] Let me check uh oh s um s uh System Seven Lotto entry.\n",

      "[P2] Okay alright <laughs>.\n",

      "[C5] Oh look I'm more than fine with that <P2 I'm not I'm not> <P2 inaudible>. I'm more than fine with the reading to be honest with you.\n",

A small piece of red satin about as big as a p a small plate. Gold thread or gold ribbon and a small piece of black hemalite {hematite} <,> which is a little black stone iron stone.\n",

And then once you've done that you say the one I love and hold so dear is travelling far away from here. Keep conditions calm and clear hold them safe and free from fear. Now you say that three times. Then you wrap the stone in the satin the g finishing off with the gold ribbon and you ask your love one to carry that with them until they return safely.\n",

      "[P2] Good evening to you. <,> Hello.\n",
      "[C6] Yes yes I'm here uh uh do uh m do you want my date I l I gave my date of birth <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P2] Yeah I've got that yeah.\n",
      "[C6] R right.\n",
      "[P2] Okay you're born the ninth the eighth.\n",
      "[C6] Yeah.\n",
      "[P2] Okay yep uh what's your question.\n",
      "[C6] I just asked the <,> the lady the what what the future with the numbers are and <,> uh y'know just things like that.\n",
      "[P2] Okay alright well you're you're in a number uh how you get your day number. Your day number's nine. Nine and eight's seventeen gives you an eight and then of course two-thousand-and-four is a six. So the number you're in's a five personal year at the moment.\n",
      "[C6] And does that <P2 alright> keep going all the time.\n",
      "[P2] No it lasts for twelve months. And then when you're in the cycle next year which will be August uh when your birthday hits you go into a six cycle. Then the year after that you go into a seven then the year after that you go into an eight cycle <C6 oh right> so it just changes each year <C6 right>. Where you are at the moment you've just gone into a five. So you're feeling restless. The next twelve months will be a big turning point. You'll feel like it's it's lots of doors closing new ones about to open. And you'll also find that there will be lots of interesting new connections coming into your life. There'll be lots of opportunities to make positive and I'm talking positive changes in your life. It should be filled of action. Filled of also lots and lots of <,> I guess travel. I guess long distance communication {break} <inaudible> turning point and it's sort of like a time that you you you really your patience will be put to the test because you feel like you want everything to happen straight away and you're feeling like oh quick quick I want things to happen they're not happening. But they are it's because you you feel more restless when you've got this particular number. Uh March will give you a lot of financial dividends because you're picking up a number eight in that month of March of next year. And February so those two months w will be look look very promising to do with finances and to do with kicking huge goals and to do with wishes coming true uh they look like dynamite months for you. And between now and then everything won't be the same it's like you're a new person it's in actually one word I would use it's reinventing. It's like you're reinventing it's like a new a brand new John.\n",
      "[C6] Huh jeez that'd be a surprise.\n",
      "[P2] Absolutely <P2 laughs> That's what I say <laugh>. Well that'll be good for you anyway.\n",
      "[P1] We have the news coming up in just a second and we're back with hour two on Sharina's Saturday Nights. Uh a little bit later tonight as well Shelley Ackerman will be joining us from I believe Germany she's still in Germany <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P2] Is that where she is.\n",
      "[P1] We'll find out from Shelley a little later. Uh plenty of your calls s still to come as well the number's thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two. Email Sharina at Two U E dot com dot A U.\n",
      "[P1] Now you can go for your life.\n",
      "[P2] Okay Bonnie hi Bon.\n",
      "[P2] I'm good doll yourself.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah well thank you.\n",
      "[P2] That's good.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah.\n",
      "[P2] Okay what can I do for you hun.\n",
      "[C7] Um I'm just wondering I'm just finishing university at the moment and I'm a bit confused about what I'll be doing next year uh d like. I'm sort of at a crossroads I don't really know what to do <,> myself so I'm just wondering um <,> yeah if you could.\n",
      "[P2] Well you you yourself you yourself you're born that with that twenty-seven day number you thinking of psychology or anything like that.\n",
      "[C7] Um.\n",
      "[P2] W with that twenty-seven that you've got there that's a <C7 yes> like and you could end up being a teacher as well they're teacher's numbers they're psychology <C7 oh really> or counselling. <inaudible>.\n",
      "[C7] Oh okay. Um that's <P2 mm> what my mum does actually <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] Oh really.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah <P2 mm>. At the moment <P2 mm>. Um yeah I'm I'm like I'm not sure whether I if I should go travelling or if I should take on a full-time job. 'Cos I've been offered a job but um yeah I don't know whether <P2 oh> <P2 inaudible> to take it or not and. Yeah so yeah I'm not really not I don't really know what to do. Or then or stay on with study a bit more so.\n",
      "[P2] Well you know <C7 yeah> what I think you're going to do.\n",
      "[C7] What will I do <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] I I'm all in favour of you taking a trip.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah.\n",
      "[P2] A short trip but really because you've got this your birthday's coming up next month and you've got <C7 yeah> a seven cycle <C7 yeah>. And I think that the sev see the seven cycle's the best time to study because you you really take it in it's this need the mind wants to learn <C7 right okay> the m the mind wants to do all this <C7 oh okay>. So I think so Bonnie <C7 good> I really think that you're going to study. And I think that you're going to end up doing being in a teaching role. And I do think you're going to go ahead and do something in that y'know that <C7 oh okay> that psychology or something in that sort of field of the healing the medis medicine whatever <C7 oh okay>. Uh <C7 right> and I think that the the trip there but I don't see it being a long trip because y you are going to study. That is my opinion there.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah 'cos I'm contemplating like sort of um teaching overseas next year like um in like in in Japan or somewhere like that.\n",
      "[P2] Well that would work in really well 'cos as I said to you I see the twenty-seven being the number of a teacher and you've just said you want to teach overseas. Well that would work out well that would that in that case if you're actually uh going on the travelli doing the travel <,> and teaching that's altogether fantastic <C7 yeah that's> <C7 inaudible>. To do with the numbers <C7 yeah yeah>. That would be brilliant.\n",
      "[C7] Yeah and what about um like just in terms of like um my love life like my <inaudible> 'cos I'm with someone at the moment but I'm bit concerned how it'll all work out for next year if I'm sort of going on a different path.\n",
      "[P1] Well you may separate <,> for a time because you've got to go and sort of do other things and <C7 yeah> I feel that it could be one of those situations that you sort of had the long distance relationship and then it it might sort of start to fizzle a bit and then <,> the year after. See you're g you're g got to realise you're gunna be meeting so many new people it's gunna be very hard to hold a relationship <,> uh down but I really feel for you that would probably the year two-thousand-and-six would be a really really good thing when you'll have your act together and what you'll y'know a time of permanency in your life. At the moment I still see that the relationship will last <,> but it's going to uh wuh obviously if if you're going off to do this sort of thing that's <C7 mm> going to be at a distance that have to sort of y'know maybe separate for a <,> a short time I don't think it's for the long term. But that's <C7 yeah> the main thing I'm seeing for you there <,> is that teaching as I mentioned at the at the beginning of the of the reading which is fabulous <C7 right yeah> and you've got the card here <C7 yeah>. The card here I've got is the card of the sun <C7 yeah>. Now the card of the sun is shining on your whole life and that is just so good to have the card of this <C7 oh that>. It's just a fabulous card. Now listen I tell you what I wanna do. I wanna give you a psychic pack so I'll <C7 yeah> put you back to the switch for a psychic pack <,> and also I'll give you a System Seven <,> Oz Lotto ticket.\n",
      "[C7] Oh excellent thank you very much <laughs>.\n",

      "[P2] And now it's that time again from That's Life magazine telling us what's happening we've got uh some great stories here. My wife lives on in my mate. Chalk and cheese stories opposites attract 'n' little Richard 33:15 Kate Curson to tell us more. Seeh.\n",
      "[P2] Senior editor. Oh g'day Kate.\n",
      "[E2] Hi how're you doing.\n",
      "[P2] Oh really well it's so busy tonight we're well we're always busy but tonight just seems to be going overboard.\n",
      "[E2] Really it might be <P2 yeah> partly the weather it's pretty uh pretty nasty out there so it's yeah people staying in 'n' and having a sh a chat with you instead <E2 and P2 laugh>.\n",
      "[P2] Maybe. May uh may I think 'n' y'know what I think it is. It's because it's coming up to spring 'n' everyone wants to know the spring and love's in the air <laughs>.\n",
      "[E2] Well that could well be <P2 and money> true yes.\n",
      "[P2] Everyone's wanting to get some new gear and and all this and wanting to know about their finances as well <laughs>.\n",
      "[E2] Oh yes everybody always wants to know about their finances don't they me included <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] Oh yes. So now l what's this my wife lives on in my mate. Wha what's that story about.\n",
      "[E2] Oh look that's a really touching one that we've got this week um it uh it relates to the whole organ donation issue.\n",
      "[P2] Oh of course.\n",
      "[E2] Yes.\n",
      "[P2] I see <E2 now> my wifes lives on my mate yes.\n",
      "[E2] That's right now <P2 okay> a lovely guy called uh called Gerald spoke to us. Uh from New South Wales and uh he and his wife Pat were very very happily married for thirty years <,> uh but then she passed away suddenly of a brain aneurysm. Um but just the week before she'd been speaking about they had this conversation about uh her wish to donate her organs. And so when doctors said that she was a candidate for that then uh Gerald knew that's what he had to do. So then thirteen years later he came across an organisation called Transplant Australia uh who offers to put donor families um and recipients in touch with each other. So he thought that that was an interesting idea he wondered y'know if anybody had been kept alive through his wife's uh organs and uh through that he met a guy called uh Bob from Adelaide and the really nice thing is they actually became really really close mates. Uh Bob actually uh was very grateful that um ih that Pat had saved his life and now they see each other whenever possible they've stayed at each other's houses and uh and Gerald was even a special guest at uh at Bob's daughter's wedding so um in a way I guess it's it's quite uh quite nice for Gerald because uh through Bob I suppose he still has a little bit of his wife living on.\n",
      "[P2] Oh that's beautiful story.\n",
      "[E2] Yeah.\n",
      "[P2] Really is. And what's chalk and cheese. Opposites attract.\n",
      "[E2] Ah well speaking of love being in the air we we take a look <P2 mm> at that this week um <P2 inaudible> we look at a couple of examples of opposites attracting which is which is quite fun and pretty common I think. Um this week we have uh the princess and the roughneck uh one girl was uh from a private school education uh yeah I think it was reasonably well off and had a good job and um and her partner was um uh was a plumber um probably I don't know from the wrong side of the tracks a little bit uh a little bit more casual with things like uh y'know dress and things like that wore stone-washed jeans and uh slightly daggy outfits. But still they managed to make it work somehow even though they've got uh y'know got uh not not got a lot of things in common I should say.\n",
      "[P2] And what about little Richard.\n",
      "[E2] Oh yes thah that's one of our spooky stories we love a good spooky story at That's Life. Um in this case we've got uh a lady who was a ward granny at a local uh Sydney hospital <,> and she looked after children who's parents couldn't visit very often. Either because they lived in the country or they just couldn't make it in uh very often. One of the babies that this lady looked after was uh a five month old boy Richard who'd been involved ih uh in a serious accident. Um now his condition was looking a little shaky um because of his injuries and uh she spent quite a time with him before he ended up sadly passing away. Um now it was about um oh I think ten months that she'd spent with him but then um the funniest thing was that uh she didn't know when he passed away uh she had actually uh taken some time off then 'n' she was at home <,> with her husband and she got the very strangest feeling a really cold icy feeling um all of a sudden when she was just sitting in her living room. And uh it seemed to follow her around the house I don't know if you've ever had this <,> ih um happen or people have reported this to you Sharina that people had an icy feeling before.\n",
      "[P2] Yes oh heaps heaps of times.\n",
      "[E2] Yes well anyway her husband actually said to her look acknowledge it just um y'know uh say say hello or a actually just acknowledge that it's there and she did do that saying look it's alright I know you're there <,> she just had a feeling that it was this little baby Richard. Anyway um so she hadn't known uh anything that had happened to him at that stage but the very next morning um baby Richard's gran phoned saying he'd passed away. Uh now she'd taken down the exact time that the little baby had died and sure enough it was spot on that was {break} he passed away.\n",
      "[P2] Amazing.\n",
      "[E2] Yes <P2 yes> yeah.\n",
      "[P2] It's just it's wonderful to hear these stories. You're after more stories aren't you. For the magazine.\n",
      "[E2] Always yes we are.\n",
      "[P2] For anyone that wants to <,> I mean there's money for them people that wanting an extra little bit of income with this wuh w talking about their finances.\n",
      "[E2] Very very true.\n",
      "[P2] No it's a.\n",

      "[P2] Okay twenty-eight's a one eight tsh uh eight 'n' six 'n' eight's fourteen's a five. Okay you're in a five. Look you've had a rough trot there for the last <,> t when you have a twenty-eighth day number <C8 mm>. You've got two eights in your birth number there you've got the eight and the eighth uh the eighty-five part. And the l probably that was a trying time that woulda been a little bit of heartache there the last twelve months or so <C8 mhm>. And now you've sort of got this you're the in the bachelor's number. So what you'll start to see is you'll start to find yourself being footloose and fancy free. You'll start to really find yourself really starting to attract lots of new friendships into the picture <C8 mhm> and out of these f new friendships one will become permanent in your life. So it's sort of like you're you're out of that that h I guess that black spot in your life <C8 yeah>. And now you're moving forward y you can expect action you can expect lots and lots of invitations to start to pour in now <,> just give it a little time here because we've only just gone into this cycle <C8 mm>. So I'd say that we're back into I'd say that you're in a committed long-term relationship there <C8 mm> roughly about the month of March <C8 inaudible>. Either you know give or take either side but it's all going to start to happen now <,> and you're going to start to meet these connections because you got <,> you got to realise that when you have that bachelor's number you can think that you wanna settle but it's really you're you're going to have the time of your life <C8 mm> it's really fabulous uh out there and what you want to do is just fix up a little bit of feng shui which we talk about on the program <C8 mhm>. Which is when you walk into your bedroom the very very far right corner put pictures of uh m married couples uh s anything representing love. Family pictures something in a red or a terracotta frame or even a vase that's red or some Phoenix ducks. Uh mandar some mandarin ducks. S ah what else can I think of. Reds even a red box y'know in that area and you can just sort of put an affirmation but that's the colours there. Gar in the gardens <,> in the backyard a red white those plants together <C8 what> in that section in the very very far right corner when you look into a room or a garden or a patio. You there.\n",

Okay we've got the card the star now that's giving you a wish coming true and it's a positive star and I really think that your heart's earnt y'know it's really you've got that <,> yearning sort of feeling for for a relationship and it will come true for you and I would say that that's sooner than you think.\n",
      "[P2] Oh I felt like doing the cha-cha for that that duh duh duh duh duh duh <P1 good one that yeah> yeah. Okay we've got Marie.\n",

Do you do you find spring and like getting outta winter you sorta feel lighter or something.\n",

      "[P2] You've got <C9 a lucky one> a race-horse.\n",

      "[C9] Ih ny oh I love horses so. But I just don't know whether this one's gunna be <,> lucky <laughs>.\n",
      "[P2] Lucky okay. Alright so l now let's look at your numbers there to start with you're born <C9 mhm> the eighth of the tenth.\n",

      "[C9] True.\n",
      "[P2] You're a you've got a lotta luck with you at the moment too it's sorta like you've got luck uh and it's starting to go every single day. Right through so <,> the eight. W wherever there's a number eight <C9 mhm> that's a number of power.\n",
      "[C9] Oh okay.\n",
      "[P2] And it's also but the eights can also have like it's a karmic number as well and I'm I'm not sorta trying to be negative saying this but I'm just saying that <,> when you have this number eight uh number <C9 mhm> it sort of like can be a time c can be a trying time to deal with it's a one number of balance you've gotta balance relationships with career and we're not talking about at the moment we're talking uhl on a lifetime situation <C9 mhm>. It's a time of sort of <,> y you get lots of rots {lots} of rewards. It's a number of business and the eight can basically do any career like you know how I w I was talking to the girl before and I said you'd be good as a teach and she was doing a teacher with a twenty-seven <C9 yep> and then we get the pers the person with a seventeen day number and a eight day number <C9 mhm> and those two words highly capable capable of anything <C9 oh okay>. Having your own business <,> uh making a success of it because you can sort of like <,> you're the sort of girl that could okay go out there and start a a catering business. Make it successful sick of this move on but you you had a go at it and you saw it through and then you moved into the entertainment industry and you then you you did something there <,> then you moved onto something else you could do it all you know what I mean.\n",

      "[P2] Your own business with the eight day number <C9 yeah>. It's you're highly capable. So you can do anything you want start any sort of business whatever you wanna do. Okay <C9 inaudible> so that's answered there with the eight cycle <C9 thank you> wuh uh coming up you're in a six cycle which is <,> and see six is particularly good for business. It's good for love <C9 mhm> but it's also good for business because your aura attracts and it's like you're communicating much better you'd be very very busy with family you'll be very very busy with uh business with career with new connections and you'll attract everything into your life <C9 inaudible>.

      "[P2] Alright okay s at that gives you a three six is a nine cycle. Okay number nine cycle. Alright. Number nine there uh in September gives you a number nine because whatever cycle you're in at the moment September will be the same number. 'Cos you're adding a nine so you've got that double nine whammy. So it's like you're finishing a chapter in your life it's like a a nine year <,> chapter and that's finishing so you're ready for another nine year block if you know what I mean.\n",
      "[C12] Yes.\n",
      "[P2] So you've got all <,> the t oh r right up until the month of probably February. From February onwards you've got a really excellent time for finances. That twelve month period from two-thousand-and-five's going to be really good for you because you've got a J initial you're picking up a number one <,> and you're going it's time to sort of be bold be daring not sit on the fence sort of be more assertive go for what you want you're going to kick some huge goals I feel and also I feel in that time it's sorta like you've got a lot of soul mate connections like people that you meet in unusual circumstances or highly unexpected times and they seem to sort of just it's like a <,> well you won't even think they're coincidences you know how you'll get a series of coincidences but they all lead to <,> new opportunities and oh it's just a really strange you'll you'll sort of question 'n' think wow what's going on it's sorta like destiny really y you can sorta see it shaping up <,> and I really feel that that time there you'll really reach the heights of success and that would be two-thousand-and-five.\n",
      "[C12] Alright terrific.\n",
      "[P2] Mm looks very very good for you uh also <,> what I'd like to do is with this time with your feng shui around finances. Just in the far left corner of any room in the home <,> when you enter a room <,> <C12 yep> and look across to the far left corner <,> <C12 yep> make sure there's no clutter in any of those sections there.\n",
      "[C12] Okay.\n",
      "[P2] The far left corner like y'know o anything when I say clutter clutter m everyone has clutter to some degree but I'm just saying things that you just don't en has n no use for you anymore <P2 yep>. And you've still got them all hoarded there in those areas. So just be careful there on that and also uh a jade plant at your front doorstep's always handy or anything to do with fish fish pictures fish ornaments right through the home.\n",

You're gunna f {break} better about yourself <C15 oh okay>. At the moment you don't <C15 yep> and you will you will find that you'll be dumbfounded by what you achieve by about the month of I would say about April.\n",

And you're going to have lots of material growth and lots of new friendships and also it's a really nice time to meet people and communicate.\n",

      "[P2] Well your relationship you're in number six personal year <C16 mm> and you're a fifteen day number as well so <,> judge that I've only got a few minutes on air uh to look at numbers and things my thoughts here well is that harmony's the key to success and I feel this month of September um I know I've been saying that to a lotta callers tonight about the number September but it's really <,> because of the nuh month of September what ever cycle you're in you're getting a double whammy of it because <,> like for instance you're in a six so you add nine you add nine to any of your numbers and you come back to what you've got like six and nine's fifteen is six <C16 mhm>. You know what I'm saying.\n",
      "[C16] Yes.\n",
      "[P2] If a person's in a four four and nine's thirteen that's why you're getting a double whammy in September and that's why I think we're so it's it's the busiest night we've had for <,> well we're always busy but the switchboard they're ringing every single number's <C16 laughs> being called tonight the <inaudible> lines are going off the hotline number there <laughs> there's faxes <C16 mm>. Anyway so what I'm saying is uh I think everyone wanting to know what's going on there but I feel that harmony's the key to success I feel that communication will be also the key here choose to communicate if you want this relationship to work it can.\n",
      "[C16] Oh I do definitely.\n",
      "[P2] Mm it's up to you.\n",
      "[C16] Yeah.\n",
      "[P2] Really. But just have a little bit more confidence in yourself be yourself and stand your ground really and say what's on your mind kih get things off the chest but the number's looking quite good get yourself a rose quartz crystal wear that if you're really worried 'cos that sends out nice energies <C16 mm>. Wear some uh pale pink pyjamas <,> and I know that might sound silly but it really has a a something uh it's like a hypnosis thing with your mind when you wear those colours the pinks it's it's everything to do with pink underwear or pink <,> uh accessories around the home pink in the garden just put a lotta pink around and that that will get you through but I feel that everything should be fine.\n",
      "[C16] Oh thank you very much <inaudible>.\n",
      "[P2] That's my pleasure.\n",
      "[C16] These experience I had that's not going to <,> the so called friend has been very very nasty to me.\n",
      "[P2] The friend.\n",
      "[C16] Yeah she's been very very nasty giving out my address and phone number uh uh for money.\n",
      "[P2] Sorry.\n",
      "[C16] She's been giving out my address and phone number for money. She's been getting the money and I've been getting the callers.\n",
      "[P2] W what sorta thing's she been doing. Do you <C16 what> whatta you mean she's been giving out your phone number.\n",
      "[C16] My phone number and address.\n",
      "[P2] Yeah.\n",
      "[C16] And charging certain amounts of money for it and male callers have been calling at my door <P2 oh>. Undesirables.\n",
      "[P2] Gosh.\n",
      "[C16] And that's caused the little rift in our relationship at the moment.\n",
      "[P2] Oh look that's that's just communication really. Uh that'll well the tr the truth always wins <C16 yeah>. Comes out it's not you what a nasty person <C16 mm yes>. Why would she do that.\n",
      "[C16] Oh because I was happy and she wasn't.\n",
      "[P2] Yeah jealousy I tell you what that jealousy's a terrible thing you you you see what people what it leads to the jealousy and it's it festers because when people aren't happy with their own life they <,> that's a terrible uh uh yeah I know a someone like that that any they love to pull put you down as soon as you've got some happiness in your life they've <C16 mm> they can't stand they love <,> they're in a good mood if you're in unhappy.\n",
      "[C16] Yeah that's true yes but trust her.\n",
      "[P2] That's what this friend's like. I mean what sort of people are they.\n",
      "[C16] Yeah well that's why I have to have police here to remove undesirable people from my door.\n",
      "[P2] Oh you poor thing.\n",
      "[C16] Mm and I've had a very hurtful five days very very.\n",
      "[P2] Have they well have they d what's the police done to her. They got proof.\n",
      "[C16] No no they can't prove it was her.\n",
      "[P2] And she was a good friend before to you too wasn't she.\n",
      "[C16] She was yes a very good friend.\n",
      "[P2] Oh gee she's got some problems. Well look it's <inaudible>.\n",
      "[C16] She has.\n",
      "[P2] Her problem and it's not yours and she's a bit she's gone a little bit nutty.\n",
      "[C16] Yes true very very true.\n",
      "[P2] And it's been for some time it's like she's uh the see th this is what jealousy can do it can just turn into a rage can turn uh it's a disease.\n",
      "[C16] Yeah and she's also told my <,> the person I'm in the relationship with a whole lotta lies about me.\n",
      "[P2] Yes yeah I thought so yeah <C16 mm>. That's what she's told and see this would devastate you because see what you do in life. People that are born on the sixth or fifteenth you put people up on pedestals <,> and you don't like to know anything bad about them or other people I I really do believe that other people would've warned you about what she's like but you didn't want to listen.\n",

      "[P2] His episode that's oke so <C23 yeah> basically is the only reason he's over there is because of the health.\n",
      "[C23] Yep. {break} <inaudible> to get him over back here and we can't at the moment.\n",

      "[C23] Yeah I've tried everything and at the moment he just falls between <,> like little gaps every when.\n",
      "[P2] Sorry what was that.\n",
      "[C23] He falls between im <,> between gaps so like he doesn't <,> he he can't go between like uh <,> not sure if I can explain. He can't the medivac won't evacuate him because it's been too long.\n",
      "[P2] Mm.\n",
      "[C23] And <,> then <,> look he he just can't do it.\n",
      "[P2] Oh this is a terrible situation <C23 yeah> for you love. Alright well look I tell you what this is uh way out of uh l I guess way out of of <C23 mhm> my league really here on the show and I've only I mean this is something this is a more serious <C23 yeah> <inaudible> than I can answer in two or three minutes and I wouldn't like to give you the wrong information <C23 mhm>. I can what I will do I'll look at your numbers and let's just sorta see how how you're sorta spanning out for <C23 mhm> the next twelve months and really I think this is there's y'know there's some probably there must be some uh higher people than myself to actually y'know get yourself some information <C23 yeah> on on what to do here <C23 mhm> y'know what I mean I'm a little bit stuck to be honest <C23 mhm>. Um li I'm just a numerologist uh okay well I'll just look at the numbers here with the eighteen you're born the eighteenth of the tenth. Nine and one is ten gives you a one and a six is a seven so you're going through some trying times which I I don't <C23 mhm> need to tell you that. You are in a number seven <C23 yeah> cycle and the seven but the the thing is the seven cycle is very spiritual. And the seven cycle it's whether you get a choice it's whether to be selfish about yourself think me me me me me and I'm not saying that's you I'm just <C23 mm> sorta saying letting the listeners know about <C23 mhm> seven or it's a time that you'll get a situation that comes into your life and it sort of tests your strength and your faith and that's exactly what I think's happening here with yourself it's testing your strength it's testing your faith. Now a magazine that I write for called That's Life magazine <C23 mhm>. There's so many stories in there of people getting back together after you you would never believe some of the stories that you actually read like they were separated for twenty years and they went through all this all this <C23 yeah> y'know heartache 'n' 'n' different <,> situations from yourself obv obviously but but they got back together. And this seven cycle for you sure really praying a lot and I think that really pray prayer would be a a good thing. Saying y y'know your prayers <C23 yeah>. And also I think <,> that you focus <,> on being together <C23 mhm> and y where there's a will there wuh there's a way because the following year it's goih it's not goih I don't sorta see it being y'know that that quick it's gunna be a long drawn out thing but <C23 mm> I feel that that my gut tells me that you'll be together next year.\n",
      "[C23] Oh.\n",
      "[P2] But it that would be that's my gut <,> and that would be in the s I'd say after the second part of next year but I really y'know I think this is a little bit not really what I can do on the on the air in cuh s such a short time but I've <C23 sure> just done the best I could <C23 yeah> for you. And I wonder who who would you suggest what sort of asso people <,> out there that we could actually uh talk to. Would there <,> there must be like Salvation Army or or someone that must have some sort of.\n",
      "[C23] Mm look I've I've spoken to people from the ambulance 'n'.\n",
      "[P2] Why don't you try <C23 everybody>. Yeah well.\n",
      "[C23] And no one can do anything.\n",
      "[P2] Mm.\n",
      "[C23] It's I've uh I think the one thing is that I've left it too late.\n",
      "[P2] Well that's what I'm sorta seeing with the <C23 mm> numbers there. So what I would suggest is y'know really prayer because <,> often if you preh you pray long enough you they'll be answered if they're needed to be answered and also uh get the necessary like try 'n' perhaps you could ring the Salvation Army or whatever and <C23 mm> just get some y'know there must be someone out there that can help you <C23 yeah>. That's li maybe even listening to this program. What abou the local M P.\n",
      "[C23] Yeah I might try that.\n",
      "[P2] There's an election coming up.\n",
      "[C23] Yes that's right.\n",
      "[P2] You know there's elections coming up <C23 mhm> so see what you can do darl.\n",
      "[C23] Okay thank you very much.\n",
      "[P2] Okay hope I c I was able but honestly your your numbers do look very trying but coming out a winner.\n",
      "[C23] Okay thank you very much.\n",
      "[P2] God bless you.\n",
